work out to windsor", "pilate dvd tapes", "and then i would make myself lunch and watch oprah", "and that was my routine every single day when i was done with school", "so i have found you know tapes

hip hop class or a fun dance class while i am working out", "i do not always love it", "but i always love how i feel after and i think when it comes to any fitness program and getting the motivation

have kept it simple to just really low impact workouts like stretching light yoga so for me", "the key is to just really listen to my own body tune into how i am feeling and trust your own intuition when it comes to your workout plan", "also determine your why and write it down obviously", "we know there are so many benefits to exercise besides the aesthetic", "so i feel like setting the intention whether it is for mental health or stamina to keep up with your kids or your lifestyle setting those intentions helps make it easier to get up and do it every day bathing is definitely part

i appreciate because i always have to put oil on after taking a shower even with the water softener that i have in my shower", "so i definitely wanted to take a very luxurious bath", "i like to call these like a massage but without the price tag because it really relaxes you and they are such a treat", "so i took my bath towards the end of the day by time", "i got out it was starting to get dark", "so i decided to take my evening supplements", "so i am taking my cbd my daily immune support mushrooms", "i usually take my multivitamin in the morning with breakfast and then in the evening i

has cooled down the shea butter", "i add a little bit of olive oil", "i add a little bit of coconut oil", "then i also add some honey which is optional", "and then you can also add a few drops of essential oil", "like again neroli is a really good essential oil and then as you can see this solidifies once it has cooled down to room temperature so then you kind of move it", "and you can put it

little if i need to go slow", "i will go slow if i get the hang of it this fabric was easy to work with so this project actually went really really smoothly once i have my half inch seam on all four

the top of the fabric i accounted for the extra fabric that is going to be needed to insert my rods my curtain rods", "so i have three inches and that will depend on the size of your rods you also want to it", "has space so you can actually move the curtains along the curtain rods", "and you will see in a second how that works so", "i have three inches", "but i also accounted for the fact that

is a quarter inch jute by a brand called park lane", "you can find it at joann fabrics for pretty affordable they also have an app that you can download with coupons i like to use their app and also save 50 off coupons when i go and pick up my fabrics or my crafty items", "so this is pretty easy to find and i am starting to glue the jute together and going around in a circle", "this is a easy way to make a juke basket with a hot glue gun", "but you want to try to work as neat and cleanly as possible", "so you do not see a whole lot of glue on the sides of your basket when it is finished i am using a mason jar or even a glass container that is already in my bathroom that i store my reusable cotton pads in as a gauge for how to the sizing basically of my jute basket", "these are actually easy and relatively fast to make even if you made a set like this it does not take very long at all", "i also made a top to go on top of my basket", "so i basically did the same thing", "and then i created a knot that i made sort of have a little bit of height there so that i can grab the top", "and i thought it turned out fun", "and it was easy to do it is also something you can do while you are sitting down watching a show or listening to a book", "and it comes together pretty quickly", "i ended up loving these so much that i made a set for myself", "and i also made them for gifts for people that i felt would appreciate this that this was their style", "several months back i got as a gift that was bought at like a fun little store", "it was these tiles that were made into coasters and it sparked an idea for me to do that for some christmas gifts", "this year there is a lot of different types of design when it comes to tile", "i decided to go with this", "i loved the design and i found it at lowe", "is now", "i could not find a three and a half by three and a half tile which was one tile that size that is what i was looking for", "and then i was gonna put feet on the bottom of that and make coasters like the ones that i got as a gift i ended up finding these tiles which you need to put four together to create three and a half by three and a half", "so i thought i would have fun with this and create unique designs and do a set of four coasters as a gift", "so what i am doing is i am going to use liquid nails", "and then i also have these tiles that are a little bit more simplistic you can buy them for very inexpensive or sometimes they even have samples that they will give you for free if you can find a three and a half by three and a half inch tile you like the style you like the look of it", "then you can flip it around and add felt feet four felt feet to the bottom in this case", "i am gluing four of the tiles on top of this sample tile", "and then the bottom is already perfect as a coaster", "and i will show you the bottom in a second here if you go the tile route you can find the felt feet to put on the bottoms to stick on the bottoms and make them coasters at joanns", "these had the perfect bottoms already to be coasters i am gifting these in sets of four", "and i also made them in two different colors and i am giving them as gifts to people who i know will appreciate this style and this vibe when it comes to coasters", "but you can do it in any style that you like or that you think the person whom you are giving the gift to will appreciate", "the next thing that is fun to do is homemade ornaments this year i am doing nature inspired ornaments", "and i am going to do this hanging planter", "i got this little teeny tiny pot from joanne for a dollar some moss and then some green paper and", "my hot glue gun", "so i am gluing the moss inside the mini pot", "it is teeny tiny", "i am going to create an aloe vera a faux aloe vera plant with this green construction paper", "oh now for the fun of it you can make a real one if you want you are gonna have to water it", "but now i am taking some yarn", "and i am gonna make a macrame hanging plant", "so this is going to be the same way you would make a large macrame hanger for a plant", "so i have three pieces of yarn that are the same length they are pretty long here", "you are going to want to go based on your own pot and the size of it that creates six total pieces of string but in sets of three", "and then i am going to create a knot on top as you can see that i am doing here once i complete that top knot", "i am going to divide the yarn into three sections of two", "then i am going to create three different knots", "try to make those knots as even as possible then we are going to continue to divide the yarn", "the knot pattern should look like a diamond", "so i am going to show you it here", "basically you want to take the yarn that is directly adjacent and create a knot until you have what looks like this", "now i watched a few videos over and over again to get this there are several videos on youtube that explain this", "specifically so if you found that confusing feel free to check out other videos this turned out to be fun", "and then i also wanted to make just a simple birdhouse or this is even fun as a fairy house", "this was definitely inspired by nature", "so i am using the rest of my moss that i got for the planter", "and i have this birdhouse that i got on sale", "you well do not do what i did", "you should definitely paint the house", "whatever color you want it to be before putting moss on it", "but i i had a little moment uh like a brain fart", "i guess and totally forgot to paint it", "i ended up painting it after the fact", "my house is gonna be gold so the gold flecks ended up looking pretty on the moss", "but i put moss on the roof and also around the bottom", "and i ended up painting it gold", "i thought that this was fun", "you could also put bird feed inside this to attract birds once it is finished drying or it is a fun ornament for the tree for a fairy you could put a little fairy on there", "as well this is also a easy gift", "and you can order this melt and pour soap on amazon", "get it within a day", "this is a easy and fast goof proof way to make soaps because all you have to do is use the base add whichever essential oils you want whatever herbs i am actually using coffee grounds and doing frankincense and myrrh for the soaps that i am giving away for the holidays that combination smells pretty incredible", "but i am currently learning hopefully for next year to make my own soap completely from scratch", "then i can customize it even more", "this is a shea butter base", "so it works perfect if you do not want to fuss with making homemade soaps 100 from scratch", "but you like the idea of customizing soaps for family or friends", "so i am stirring this together", "basically all you have to do is like it says melt and pour and add whatever you want in there", "so this is a little bit messy to be honest", "i am not the cleanest soap maker", "but they come out pretty nice once they have a chance to set", "and then i am going to put them in little muslin bags and give them as gifts", "now i like to give them an addition to other things so if i am knitting a scarf i am going to maybe give a soap and a scarf or the baskets and soap or the tiles or the tile coasters and soap", "so you get the idea a few different homemade gifts this year", "my big goal for christmas was to be less of a consumer and more of a producer when it came to gifts so everybody in the family got at least something homemade from me", "and anyway i hope they enjoy", "and i wanted to share with you since this is what i have been up to um", "so i hope you enjoy this video", "please be sure to subscribe to my channel if you like my videos that helps me out a lot", "also you can follow me on instagram", "i just discovered reels over there", "so i am starting to share some of my creative ideas on instagram via reels and igtv for shorter videos that you can watch

made in partnership with foreo sweden i have been using their ufo2 today", "i am actually making a easy diy mask to use with my device i am slowly trying to simplify my routine", "there is a few switch ups i have made so i am just going to share with you what i am doing this winter season and during quarantine", "so i hope you enjoy this video", "and i am gonna jump right in exfoliating my entire body", "has always been a part of my routine in the past", "i used synthetic mitts to exfoliate in the shower i also like dry brushing as well and have been doing that for many years", "but you can find these natural fiber mitts", "also there is a long one for reaching the back", "so i do this a few times a week definitely not before every shower", "i am pretty rigorous with it", "i have been doing it for years on my channel", "i like to share what works for me what works for me may not work for you", "but you could always try exfoliating", "i have always liked dry brushing", "so i have a few different options my skin does get a little flushed for a few minutes you definitely feel takes a little getting used to when you dry brush", "but i have always liked it", "i recently switched to these very simple handmade bars of soap that i find from a local maker at a farmer", "is market", "they are artisanal soaps they smell incredible", "i also switched over my shower to a filtered shower head it does filter out chlorine and really just softens your water", "i do not have a system throughout my house", "so this has been a great addition to my shower routine as you can see with the dinosaur", "this is a shower that the whole family enjoys using even though it is in my master bathroom", "so i", "i appreciate the soft water for sure", "and i have been using shampoo and conditioner soap bars as well for my skin in the winter", "i like to pump it up with a heavy but botanical based body cream that i like to mix with oil i have been doing a variation of this combination for years especially when my skin needs it during the winter months and when i say winter in terms of california we just get windy days and it can get dry", "so we do not have a lot of humidity here", "so my skin does feel super super dry", "i have not had a haircut since quarantine started", "so i have been giving my ends little trims at home", "i got a pair of scissors from", "i think i do not know amazon", "and i have been sort of trimming my ends to keep up with my hair", "but i have not", "you know i have not had my hair cut or styled", "it is been almost a year i would say so just trimming up my ends very very minor here because i am not a hair stylist by any means", "but i can sort of take care of my own ends for now", "instead of using exfoliants i switched to a facial dry brush this is definitely a little softer than the ones that i use on my body and it was a more recent purchase that i have liked a lot of the dry brushes that i have tried fall apart easily", "and this one has been great", "and i use it pretty much", "i d say almost every day", "every other day sometimes i forget again", "but i use it when i need it", "and it is how i have been exfoliating the skin on my face", "exclusively i am trying to think of things that will last for a long time that i can take really good care of that will benefit my skin rather than buying product after product after product", "sometimes i get a chance to try fun things sometimes things are sent to me but for my routine i am trying to keep it as simple as possible", "so i am actually going to be using a few drops of this oil", "it says it is a facial oil", "i get it from trader joe", "is", "but i also use it on my body", "and i kind of it is an all purpose oil for me a few drops of that", "and then one drop of jasmine essential oil and i am going to gently bring that through my hair now", "i will say that since i have switched to the shampoo bars and the conditioner bars and more natural products sometimes my hair does look and feel kind of greasy so it is something i am just kind of getting used to and balancing what i am using in my hair to accommodate sometimes the things that you find at the store they work better for your skin or your hair", "and i have definitely been in that predicament as well", "sometimes it takes a little experimenting to find what works right for you a little tiny bit of oil in my scalp and also focusing on my ends as long as i do not put too much my hair receives it", "pretty well", "so you kind of have to go with your hair type", "and you know you have to go with what works for you but sharing what i have been doing lately", "i also like to give myself a really intentional scalp massage that always feels good", "and then i am going to do a facial treatment using the foreo", "ufo2", "this is a smart masking device and skin care infuser today i am going to be making a diy version of the masks that go on the ufo2 super simple",

getting a professional treatment", "but you can do it for yourself at home", "so i am cutting that into a circle", "and then i am using a little a few drops of oil and also aloe vera gel i am going to infuse that with my device for rayo developed masks to use specifically with the device they have ones called farm to face with really proprietary ingredients for your skin", "they actually are wonderful but you could use the device in so many different ways because the ufo has hyperinfusion technology which helps infuse the essence of serums creams moisturizers sheet masks", "so today i am making a very simple one with aloe vera a little bit of oil", "and i am using the device which has cryotherapy which is cooling so that shrinks the appearance of pores lifts and firms the skin reduces any puffiness led light benefits and also t sonic pulsations which the pulsations gently release muscle tension they help boost radiance and massage the face", "as well i absolutely love the thermotherapy so the warming feature my skin looks so much better when i use this with either my own mask or one of the masks that 4ao sells to go with the device", "any makeup is pretty minimal these days i usually do a little concealer if needed and then some mascara and chapstick", "i have a pack of bamboo toothbrushes that i use", "and i took one of them to use for brushing my eyebrows so that is what i am doing here", "and then a little bit of mascara i always feel like mascara just makes me look a little bit more awake", "so sometimes i put it on even if i am not going anywhere this time of the year", "like i said it gets windy and dry my lips get pretty chapped", "so i apply a very simple lip balm every single day and sometimes if i feel like i need it", "i will put a little bit of egyptian magic underneath my eyes and on my eyebrows and a little bit on my ends", "and then i just get ready for the day", "and if i want to blow dry my hair especially if it is a cold day", "our weather is sort of all over the place here in california", "so sometimes we will have warm days", "usually the mornings are really cold and then it sometimes warms up or sometimes stays cold", "it depends", "so i will blow dry my hair", "if it is a cold day i will let it dry naturally if it is a warm day or i will put it in a little bun or braid", "so this is what my routine is looking like winter 2020", "i am curious if your routine this year has stayed the same or if it looks a little bit different", "so i would love to hear what you are doing in the comments as always thanks for

channel", "i have been a little m i a", "and i wanted to share with you guys what i have been up to", "so i am going to share a little holiday in quarantine 2020 a highlight of what i have been doing the last few weeks we have been decorating slowly little by little also making homemade gifts and just trying to enjoy this holiday season that looks a little bit different but the same in a lot of ways as well", "so i hope you enjoy this video", "and i am going to jump right in the last few weeks since thanksgiving have been kind of busy around here", "and i have not had a chance to film complete videos", "but i have been filming a little bit here", "and there so after the day we had thanksgiving here at our house a small little get together with our family that we have been quarantining with so", "that is why cooked and had that here", "and then i wanted to get a bunch of work done on the property just preparing for our california winter which is windy we get frost in the mornings and the evenings", "and it is not crazy like in other places", "but we definitely still have to prepare the outside so while i was out in the barn or the shack we call it either or i brought the tree in this tree", "looks fantastic but it is easy to assemble it is three pieces that you kind of stack on top of each other", "so i use the dolly to bring it in and put it together", "and then you plug it in and turn it on and then decorate as you wish", "about two years ago i got brute boxes for all the christmas decorations and i organized them in the garage they are labeled", "so i pull all the boxes down when it is time to decorate", "and i label them according to which area of the house", "the decorations are for this year", "was the first year that i did not buy any new decorations i am just trying to stick with what i have keep it pretty simple", "but i got this really beautiful sign on sale", "last year i pulled out a lot of the christmas signs that said joy this year every year looks a little bit different you can go back to some of my decorating and holiday videos to see what i have done throughout the years", "but this year i wanted the theme to be focused on joy since i know", "this year has been a little bit different holidays in quarantine have looked a little different we have not been able to see all of our family and friends", "but we still want to try to stay really thankful and joyful during this time and stay focused on the meaning of this time of the year", "oh i see it", "every year that passes and my sweet boys are getting older they enjoy being a part of the decorating in the past i sort of just took care of it myself", "but i have been trying to that they have a chance to stay involved", "and it has not felt like christmas to be honest because on we have had a few cold days", "but it is been kind of warm", "the mornings are cold and then it starts to warm up", "but we are still enjoying decorating", "and they were having a blast putting on the ornaments which most of them are plastic", "so we could uh enjoy that oh cool another fun thing i have been up to the last few weeks is learning to sew my grandmother was a fantastic seamstress but i did not live close to her", "and i never learned growing up", "but my sister in law she actually has a channel a fun crafty channel here on youtube", "her name is melanie", "she", "uh she let me one of her sewing machines", "and i actually took her learn to sew series class on her blog which leaped me into a whole direction of watching so many different videos and creators and learning to sew and experimenting", "i also got great deals on fabric for black friday", "and i was having a lot of fun being creative with fabrics", "so i wanted to make as many handmade gifts homemade gifts this year as possible granted keeping in mind that i just started to learn the week of thanksgiving so not being too hard on myself", "but when i get free time during the boys naps that is what i have been", "hyper focusing on", "and i tend to do that when i am learning something new i hyper focus until i figure it out", "i usually fail and then slowly figure it out for myself", "and", "and then it becomes a part of my lifestyle which i love because it becomes easier as you do it more consistently", "so i made these kitchen towels with this really fun fabric i found at joann", "is", "and then i have actually been finding fun fabric on etsy for future projects and", "i am slowly getting better which with each project that i do once i finished the kitchen towels i just ended up putting one of our pacific time labels on it because i do not know i thought it was a fun little prototype and also a gift", "so i made one for our family", "and then i also made a few for other members of the family and", "it is really been experimenting", "so every gift is gonna have a little flaw in it", "but i am learning as i go", "and i have been having an absolute blast i did not know that i would love it so much", "but it is been great the other thing that i have been making", "is these lavender pillows they are kind of like mini pillows you have rice and dried lavender", "so i actually have some dried lavender from the garden from what we grew in the spring in the summer", "and i kept that", "and then i added some essential oil lavender essential oil to the rice", "and then i measure like a rectangular pillow very simple stitch", "and then i turn it inside out", "i add the rice inside and then again a very simple stitch on top and this is not a tutorial i kind of wanted to share with you what i have been up to because i am not quite ready to do tutorials on this yet since i am still technically learning and failing and learning as i go", "but i just wanted to show you what i have been up to because i", "i know i have not been making a whole lot of content", "but this is what i have been doing", "so i am putting the rice in there which makes it smell", "really nice", "this is a great gift for honestly so many people like it", "kids like it", "as well i have one for my son as well", "and he likes to sleep with it", "so it is kind of a fun little mini pillow that smells amazing", "so i am also making those for gifts this year", "if you are interested in learning to sew i would highly recommend checking out my sister in law is blog and also there are so many great resources to learn these things and this year has been about that for me i have wanted to learn a lot of new skills i have taken this time in quarantine to focus on learning new skills and it is been a beautiful experience i love it", "my form of expression", "my joy in life is creativity in all different forms and so it is just really fun for me to do all of these things when i have time to do them", "and i also was making soap for homemade gifts this year i am also taking a little mini course on soap making but this is a very simple", "you just buy the soap base you can add essential oils to it if you want and then pour it into a mold", "it is", "simple anybody can do it", "i will put the soap base in the description", "this is an olive oil soap base", "and i added frankincense and myrrh just because i actually love those two scents together", "they are amazing", "but it also represents christmas right", "so i made this in this beautiful mold which reminds me of a music box i had as a child that looked exactly like this", "and i will also link the mold i also learned to knit during the thanksgiving week", "so it was a combination of sewing and knitting for knitting", "i learned the basics about casting on casting off knit stitch and purl stitch from sheep and stitch which is a channel here on youtube i kind of watched her videos over and over and over again and really practiced knit stitch over and over and over again", "so i made my first scarf which actually turned out pretty good", "but now i am making my second scarf and also 100 cotton washcloths for the face that will also be gifts so you can also find great yarn on etsy", "but i download the joanns app and also the hobby lobby app on my phone", "and when they have sales that is usually when i bulk up on the yarn and been having fun the first time i bought really simplistic yarn for the first scarf because i did not know how far i would get or if i would mess up have to start all over again which sometimes i did", "but right now i am on my second scarf and", "i am also making 100 cotton face washcloths and it is been so fun the claw the face wash claws are going to be gifts for christmas this year", "and um i am just enjoying it", "i am having such a blast this year has looked different in some ways but also the same in other ways as well we always have family come to visit us for christmas", "this year they are driving uh byron is side of the family", "and you know we have a few members battling cancer right now", "so we are aware of the fact that life is short and family is so important", "and so so i have also been preparing for family to visit", "i have lots of videos in the past that i have made so in order to not be redundant", "i will just mention i have so many different like holiday prep guest prep videos so you can check those out but basically that is what i have been up to", "as well i do feel like", "this year i have not really been able to be as creative on this platform but more just sharing what i have been up to and being creative in other ways in my life trying to develop new skills and also put my family first and foremost", "so anyway i hope you enjoy my videos", "thank you so much for watching i hope this inspired you in some way and that you are having a happy holiday in quarantine i am thinking about", "you thank you so

be a healthy breakfast ideas video sharing with you what i like to eat for breakfast", "and i am trying to make a lot more homemade these days", "so i actually made the almond coconut yogurt from scratch", "i also made some overnight oats and this past week i have been experimenting and trying to dial in my bread", "making skills after much trial and error i have been able to get closer to a sliceable whole wheat bread for our family so my thrive market box came in the mail", "i was so excited it is the inspiration for this video", "and i want to thank them for sponsoring this video as well", "if you do not know about thrive market they are an online membership based market with healthy items available that come right to your door um guaranteed savings as a member there are two different types of membership a one month membership or a 12 month you get a free gift when you sign up", "and they have all of the most amazing healthy items for your home you can find thousands of wholesome food home and beauty products curated for their members on the website keto paleo gluten free vegan non gmo it makes everything easy hassle free comes right to your door and especially during quarantine that just makes life so much easier", "so today for this week i am actually going to be making some almond milk from home using my almond cow machine i usually do cashew or oat", "but today i am making almond yogurt from my experience so far making yogurt almond makes the best yogurt either almond or cashew so you can go for either ore", "and i will put the recipe below in my description box", "you are going to need the culture starter", "and so i found that on thrive one portion of almond milk is set aside and you add pectin to it", "you can blend it in a blender the other portion is going to be slowly warmed up to 140 degrees", "and you add a little bit of calcium water", "then you mix those two together and raise the temperature to 140 degrees again", "and you want to stir so that there are no lumps for vegan yogurt", "you are definitely going to need a thickening agent like pectin and calcium water because it will have that yogurt like texture", "and so then i am going to allow that to cool down to 110 degrees", "and then i can add my yogurt culture which the culture is what gives it that tangy taste and also the good bacteria that we love so much in our yogurt", "i added a splash of canned coconut milk", "and then once it is cooled down to 110 degrees i can add my starter culture which comes in these little packets there are several of them", "so hypothetically you can make a lot of homemade yogurt which is really nice", "it ends up saving you money in the long run", "and it is nice to know that your yogurt is made with as few ingredients", "as possible this yogurt culture also had amazing reviews", "so what i can do here is my mixture at 110 degrees can now be either put in a crock pot that can stay at 110 degrees or it can be put in a yogurt maker", "my mom has a yogurt maker that she shared with me", "so i am making a very large batch and basically you put your liquid in there", "you are gonna let that culture for six to eight hours", "so that is what is gonna give it that tangy flavor and allow your culture to grow after six to eight hours", "you are gonna let it set to room temperature and then put it in the refrigerator overnight", "so it has a chance to thicken in the morning once the yogurt has set i am going to transfer it over to a mason jar", "i can keep that in the refrigerator it might take a little bit of getting used to to find the texture that you like for your yogurt", "but this one actually turned out perfect", "and i was trying to mimic the almond coconut yogurt that i like to get at the health food store", "and it is perfect to know that i was able to make it from home with minimal ingredients and the way that i like to enjoy my yogurt", "is by adding a little bit of turmeric which i ended up buying a big bag of turmeric that came in my thrive market box as well", "right now is a tricky time to make it to any small spice shops so it is nice to have places like thrive that can deliver these healthy ingredients directly to your home i have been studying ayurveda in my herbal studies turmeric is a warming spice that promotes blood flow and stimulates digestion hemp hearts have a lot of essential fatty acids and also a lot of protein", "so i like to add that to my morning gruel", "i was out of chia seeds so very excited that that also came in my thrive box the organic mama chia seeds that i like to use in my morning grill", "but i also like to make chia pudding chia juice", "there is so many great recipes when it comes to chia seeds", "so you can either make this before bed or in the morning and allow those chia seeds to plump out a little bit", "i love the flavor of turmeric plus the many benefits it is very earthy", "i added a tiny bit of sugar to this", "but this tastes exactly like the almond yogurt that i get from the store and the different ingredients that i like to add to it for health benefits on any given morning", "i go based on what i feel my body wants to drink so some mornings it is just water some mornings i like to have a cup of coffee or a cup of tea", "you can also buy organic teas on thrive market", "so i am having an organic jasmine green tea which i love so much so", "that is one breakfast idea that i like to enjoy", "and you could change it up based on your preferences i also like mesa sunrise cereal with a little bit of nut milk or oat milk", "so i will usually make just enough oat milk for the week to enjoy with cereal if i want a quick breakfast", "this morning i am having some fresh carrot juice with my breakfast", "as well i also like to do overnight oats", "we are getting low on oats", "right now i did order some muesli from my thrive market box and", "so that is what i am going to use to make my overnight oats", "i am also adding some hemp hearts some flax seeds and some chia seeds as well and sort of layering it in a mason jar", "then i am going to cover that completely with some homemade coconut milk", "just everything is covered with the coconut milk and leave a little bit of space because it will expand a little bit and then in the morning you have a cold overnight oats cereal or you can do that warm as well", "but this is nice for a quick on the go breakfast on most mornings we do enjoy a nice hot cup of coffee in our pour over our coffee making habits", "have definitely changed so that is why do buy ground coffee", "and we were running low", "so i ordered this organic coffee from thrive", "this is a pumpkin spice flavor it is grown regeneratively ethically and sustainably which i love on the back of the package i was reading in the morning all of the details about this beautiful coffee", "i would love to try roasting beans in the future but we are not quite there yet", "so this was perfect very flavorful", "and so we often enjoy a good cup of coffee and it is a wonderful ritual in the morning", "i just love watching the coffee grounds and doing the whole pour over process another thing that i have been really trying to dial in", "is my bread making skills i watched a um i guess a class a mini class", "it was free from homesteading family and it is been trial and error", "but i think i am finally getting closer to a good recipe that hopefully i will share soon", "it is less about the recipe honestly and more about the skill of making dough and understanding what the dough needs to feel and look like", "so this is a whole wheat bread that i made for the week", "and i am actually going to make egg in a hole with eggs from our chickens and my

loving it", "the other habit that i have been slowly developing over the last few years really the last five years is being a lot more mindful about what i eat not following fads or trends but moving away from that and focusing on building soil growing our own food and that entire process supporting local farmers who are growing what we are not and also being more aware of prices uh where i am

half of an onion with two cloves of garlic in my oven", "and i let that get nice and brown", "just just right before it is getting ready to burn you do not want it to burn", "but then i have thyme

this", "i am gonna have to strain it", "so that is the thing with using the scraps from the juicing", "but i can also add bay leaves salt and pepper to taste and any other flavorings that you d like",

glass mason jars but just starting to think about food that way and not be as wasteful and get as much out of it as possible canning", "is another skill that i have been wanting to develop", "but it was intimidating for me", "so i watched a few courses on it", "there are some details that you want to learn when it comes to canning the ball canning has a good protocol they have a book on water

stimulating to the scalp", "and you have argan oil which is very healing for the hair and really hydrating for the hair", "so i am going to start massaging into the scalp slowly saturate my hair with the oil and also bring it down to my ends after i saturate my hair with these beautiful oils i am going to put my hair in a bun", "and then i am actually going to sleep with that in my hair",

tried to get the perfect one in my shop", "and i just could not find one that did not shed that was as high quality but as soft as this one the apothecary shop that i bought this dry brush from also shared a video it is actually right there on amazon or on their website", "and it shows how to properly use this", "so there are some brushing movements that encourage lymphatic drainage and then brushing upward", "so i will actually link the exact one i bought and then the videos there as well", "but um this has very quickly become a part of my everyday routine um something that i am slowly

tea and there is so many great uses for herbs such as calendula and chamomile", "so i thought an herbal poultice would be perfect mine", "is most certainly not going to look perfect because i am still new to making this a thai poultice massage is a technique that involves special poultices made of herbs and spices wrapped in muslin or cotton and steam heated so the steam heating allows the natural essential oils you know the herbal benefits to be released during massage great for relaxing the skin and the muscles also offering comfort smells amazing", "you can also do this with a cooked rice which is really softening to the skin i am gently massaging in an upward motion and plumping the skin fingertip to palm gently from my lip underneath my zygomatic bone", "this gently lifts and plumps the skin while infusing the benefits of the herbs into the skin and the muscles", "so a very great way to enhance a massage or a facial now if you make several of these you can put it in a crock pot to heat it up", "but i like to stick it in some hot water and allow it to sit for a few minutes and touch it against my skin to it", "is not too hot since it is warm", "it is going to encourage blood flow to the surface of the skin", "so there are so many benefits to a poultice treatment and you can reuse this as well once it dries you can reuse it a few different times", "so i am also heading to the garden to grab some aloe vera blue", "my little garden kitty is always very curious about what i am up to whenever i am in the garden herbs are beneficial for so many but there are some that are very sensitive or have allergies to certain herbs so keep that in mind try a small patch on the side of your neck to double check to that you do not have any reaction in general aloe vera is pretty good for most people and has so many benefits to the skin", "so today i am actually going to be combining some aloe vera some argan oil and also some blue healing clay i like to also keep some blue healing clay in my apothecary cabinet something i order", "kind of i guess you could say in bulk", "and then i like to make a one off mask treatment like what i am doing here so try not to make too much make just enough that i can put on my skin but also you know you could do a full body mask if you wanted to that", "would be quite a bit of mask", "but you could make it", "and if you wanted to do a full body treatment you certainly could do that it is been a long time since i have done something like that", "but i do like to make masks from what i am growing and also some of the oils and

cleansing and renewal dry brushing", "is very much a part of my routine i have been doing it for years and", "the dry brush on my body is of course a little a little bit stronger than the one that i use on my face", "and i love that because it gives a nice exfoliation", "but i have had a lot of you email me and say that that does not work for you that dry brushing actually makes your skin look or feel worse so if you are sensitive try a small patch again and see if it works for you", "but it is very much a part of my routine also bathing", "is a ritual of mine which is why i created bath bombs

previous year", "so you can see there is a few little nibbles on there", "but that comes with organic gardening", "we have cooked lots of bok choy it is not", "it is actually the one thing in the

abundance of lemon balm and peppermint so while i am here", "i am going to go ahead and harvest a bunch of it", "and before i start dinner i am going to hang some herbs in the kitchen", "this year we have had a great harvest for the fall", "and i have been excited to bring it in from the garden and display it in our kitchen until we get a chance to use it", "and so that is what i am gonna do with

excited to watch", "so here they are playing uno waiting for their special cheesy pasta dinner", "and then i make them hot chocolate a little bit later in the night and send them off to their room to enjoy their movies we always eat dinner as a family", "i usually never cook them a separate meal", "but tonight i wanted to make it a little special so that is why could be excited and that we could try to get date night in even with the kids home", "so the way we like to roast squash is i cut the ends of the squash", "so that is why i have a flat surface to cut down the center", "and then i remove the inside", "so the seeds we save that for the compost are actually the cats like squash seeds and it is pretty good if you want to roast those up", "as well you can do that", "so that is why save that", "and then i put that on a oven safe tray", "i am going to add some chopped sage", "but before i add the sage i am going to add some pepper some salt some olive oil", "and then the sage you can also add some honey or brown sugar that gives it a beautiful complex flavor which we like to do when we roast the squash so very easy to do you want to roast it on 400 degrees in the oven for about 35 to 45 minutes you want it to be soft on the inside", "this is our favorite way to roast squash", "it is easy and super delicious", "so i am gonna get that started since that takes the longest", "and then i am going to start making the rice", "um i d say probably about 20 minutes before the squash is done", "and then i am going to save the bok choy to the very end", "then i am going to get the boys settled with their dinner and in their room to start their movie so that we can start our aperitif tasting now", "of course we are not gonna have too much to drink because we still have the kids home", "but we are gonna have a mild tasting tonight", "we tasted the lemon lavender which was amazing", "and i think i have so many ideas for a spritzer", "i could even put some fresh lavender and lemon in there um", "but i wanted to just sip on the bitter clove that also tastes good over ice", "we just have these little aperitif glasses so that is why we put them in these glasses and sipped it straight", "and it tastes beautifully so that is why as well so there is many ways to enjoy these and many ways that we have enjoyed these since we got our bottles in the mail", "i also enjoyed the pamphlet where i read about the couple who owns this company they have a farm they are a young couple", "and they are mindful about their ingredients transparent", "so we enjoyed sipping on our appetites for the next few minutes while we waited for our squash to finish up and we could get finished with the rest of the dinner", "i also planned for the boys to be able to have hot chocolate after they finished their meal", "so i had a few surprises kind of ready to go for them so that it would keep them busy and excited", "so i poured them", "some hot chocolate let that cool down", "and then i brought that into their room as a little treat next", "so i am getting started with the rice", "this is actually a recipe my grandmother is recipe for a rice pilaf", "so i am starting with egg noodles and butter and i am browning those egg noodles", "and then i am going to add some veggie stock and some rice and then cook the rice until it is um until it is done", "and then byron is starting on the dessert here he is making a variation of a baked apple so that is why have got the butter cinnamon brown sugar", "and then we are going to add some of that bitter clove aperitif to it as well which is perfect because clove pairs so perfectly with it starting with a little olive oil and chopped garlic", "actually byron is going to finish off the bok choy and this is often how we do cook together", "you know sometimes i will cook the full meal or he will cook the full meal", "but we like to cook together and kind of each taking", "turns i sometimes will get started and he will finish it off because he really just has such a great touch with food obviously that he does such a great job", "so adding some salt and pepper and some lemon at the end really finishes off this beautiful bok choy dish really easy", "so that is why have our rice", "we have our squash and we are ready to go with our dinner", "so there is nothing we love more than a good solid meal and having a chance to sit down in peace and quiet and chat which does not get a chance", "you know we do not get a chance to do that too often", "but tonight we tried to make it happen and it worked out", "pretty well", "so um we also made this or byron made this delicious dessert we enjoyed some of it", "and then we saved a little bit for the kids brought it to them", "then they had their

"so often our routines can feel rushed", "so this is a time to slow down and create the intention to take care of your skin and focus on your skin for the moment", "so i am taking that time with the steam towel", "and then i am going to use a vitamin c cleanser that i have", "i have had for a while i am going to finish this one up", "and i am going to begin to cleanse my skin when it comes to giving yourself a facial i think slowing down each step being thoughtful and intentional with what you are doing makes", "all the difference and it is no different with cleanser taking the time with the cleanse to give yourself a massage move your hands in an upward motion and at many spas during facials", "sometimes they do a double cleanse", "so they cleanse once", "and they cleanse again", "sometimes they do a cleanse and then an oil cleanse or a milk cleanse after a solid cleanse exfoliation is the next step so i am using a microdermabrasion cream that i got from trader joe", "is again finishing this one up for the price point this one is not too shabby", "but there are a few other ways that i like to exfoliate and i will share that in upcoming facial videos that i plan to do in the next few months", "but i am using this one up", "and i will either use a physical exfoliation like a facial dry brush or something like this that has granules in it", "a chemical exfoliation usually uses some type of acid like malic acid from apples or lactic acid from milk or glycolic acid", "so these are also ways to exfoliate your skin today i am going to use this physical exfoliation and again moving my hands going upward", "and then i am going to use my second towel to gently remove this microdermabrasion cream off of my skin next i am going to give myself a micro current treatment using the bare mini by foreo", "and i am using the serum their hyaluronic acid serum that they sent me to use with the device", "and it allows the device to to glide smoothly on the skin", "so i apply serum before i start my treatment", "and then they also have an app that works with the device so you can register your device you can shop for products", "but you can also follow along with treatments", "and it really gives you a step by step on how to complete each treatment i do enjoy microcurrent", "i enjoy it when i get it in a facial if i get a chance to do it consistently at home",

device is much more compact than ones i have seen in the past", "it is shock free so that is why do not get that kind of shocking feeling", "i always felt like after a microcurrent treatment my skin looked more awake", "you know sometimes i", "i noticed like i have that resting face", "and so my face kind of starts to look sad and depressed", "and i am losing the energy in my face", "so i love the t pulsation i love the microcurrent and when you use microcurrent your skin cells they break down", "and then they grow back stronger just the same way your muscles do when you are lifting weights", "and we all know that when we exercise and when we have energy and life in our skin and in our muscles and movement we look better", "you know it is just just the truth", "and i do feel that way with microcurrent", "and i love that this one is so portable easy convenient today i am layering skincare treatments", "so next i am going to be using the youth junkie mask which promotes collagen buildup and improves elasticity for firmer and younger looking skin", "this pairs perfectly with the ufo2", "and is designed to fit easily onto this device", "and then the device infuses the benefits of the mask into the skin and", "it uses thermotherapy so heating to help lock in the ingredients of the mask warming", "the skin red light therapy has been proven scientifically to actually heal the skin there was a study done by nasa many years ago about red light therapy in astronauts in space very very interesting so that is why have that technology you have the green light therapy which is amazing for hyper hyperpigmentation on the skin", "so the ufo2 offers full led spectrum with eight different colors and each mask comes with its own routine that you can get by connecting your device to the foreo app these sheet masks made my skin look amazing", "but i am trying to slowly move out of reusable skin care", "i did not mention that to the brand", "and they totally understood this device is meant to be used with these sheet masks", "but you could make your own i like to make my own sheet masks and cut them to fit with aloe vera from the garden or you could use with serum or masks that you already have and still get the wonderful benefits of the ufo2 device it feels nice and warm", "the pulsations feel amazing waking up the skin getting red or green light therapy at a spa definitely comes at a premium cost", "so i love that you get this in one quick treatment", "and it is portable there is another led mask that i have that is kind of a bigger more cumbersome design", "so i do not use it all of that often", "but this feels like updated technology and it could fit into your routine quickly and easily so after i complete the facial i am going to brush my brows", "put some mascara on a little concealer", "a little lip balm maybe a little blush and", "i will say my skin was glowing for three days after this treatment significantly different", "i noticed my skin looked just so much better over the course of the next few days so combining the treatments together made a difference", "as well i do think that microcurrent and led light therapy are beneficial for the skin", "and i love to use them as a part of my routine", "my next facial is going to be completely herbal", "and i have i am very excited about some of the things i have been studying to share with you and the series that i am going to do on different facials that you can perform at home", "i appreciate you guys watching this video huge thanks to foreo for partnering with me on this video

looking like right now before the pandemic both my sons were in school", "isaiah was in a beautiful montessori uh preschool which he loved", "and it was so cute", "and then oliver was", "i did a district transfer", "so that is why was in a fantastic school", "i loved his teacher a few minutes away it was great", "and we were excited as parents because it gave us some time during the day to get things done and to have uninterrupted work time in march when everything happened", "obviously we pulled both the boys out of school", "we pulled them out", "early even before it was like official because we were concerned about the virus and we started the distance learning which was a little chaotic", "and i was a little nervous about what it would look like this year for his first grade year", "so i started looking into homeschooling in the summer looking into a few different options curriculums", "but i wanted to make sure i was giving him a proper education", "and i did not feel like i was necessarily qualified to do that", "so i wanted to give the public school that he was at", "i wanted to give them a chance to do distance learning for his first grade year and see how it went if it was not going", "well i was going to pull him", "and i had a backup plan for homeschool", "but it was like", "three days before school started they said he was going to have a designated zoom teacher a classroom", "and it was going to be at home", "so so that is why recently switched over to his own learning room", "and we are doing distance learning", "so he has a teacher that i love so much", "she is amazing and", "honestly just being able i feel lucky that i have been able to see the classroom from a different perspective see how oliver interacts in the class help him as well you know because she is doing reading in the morning at nine o clock", "and then she is also doing mathematics and a lot of times i will sit there and listen to kind of see where they are at", "but i also have to be on top of making sure he is getting a lot of the other things done which it definitely takes parent interaction", "it is not like she is able to do everything she does the classroom", "and then they break you know", "when we did our parent teacher conference with his teacher i told her how much i appreciated her because i do not think i knew what it meant to be a great teacher until she modeled that for me", "and i i see what it means to be a good teacher and", "how much patience you have to have", "and i i do feel more confident now that if i did want to homeschool next year that i maybe could because of her example", "and so you know basically what we do is in the morning", "we have our you know routine", "sometimes i am up early before everybody else", "and i am getting the chores done i am cleaning up the kitchen", "i am getting ready of course", "we have breakfast", "do you see one and then school starts at nine o clock so when we were previously in the music room for learning i now have a specific room just for schooling we have chalkboards we have maps we have", "you know the teacher gives us a schedule every week", "i print out that schedule i put it out every day we are writing on the chalkboard what needs to be done not for school but for chores and for exercise to that", "you know oliver is a task oriented child i am a task oriented person i work really well", "if i have a checklist", "and he", "he is the same way and", "so having that every day for him to say like this is what we are getting done because once you get off zoom there is still science there is still you know reading time there is different ipad programs that they have them doing there is a lot in the curriculum that needs to be done and", "that you know the parent is responsible for overseeing to it gets done and do not get me wrong", "i was struggling to that", "i was balancing farm took over because we started growing a lot more and really focusing on homesteading because who wants to go to the grocery store", "right right now it is the grocery stores especially in you know", "march and april it was scary to go to the grocery stores", "and so we started growing a lot more food and wanting to experiment with canning and", "it is been for the better it is been amazing for our family", "we are getting into a groove", "and i think that now that we are in this groove i could see homeschooling definitely being a part of our life in the future", "so our schedule pretty much looks like that in the mornings we are all up at around 7 30", "we have breakfast either byron or myself", "does chores and the kids are usually cleaning up after their breakfast we are trying to instill just basic skills and respect for each other in this home you know cleaning up after ourselves that type of thing obviously when we are all home all day long", "it is you know important to be responsible to all care about each other and support each other and so that is why know", "so that is why mom and dad can get their work done", "and everybody can get their schoolwork done", "and we all feel happy at the end of the day so um one of us is taking care of cleaning up breakfast getting everybody organized", "somebody is doing the farm chores", "and then we are starting to get together for nine o clock when he has to be on zoom after that class is over we go through our checklist of what we need to get done so that is why look on the chalkboard and what are the other things that are required for that day", "so thankfully again the teacher is giving us a curriculum to work through every week she gives us a calendar which is amazing", "so all i have to do is i am managing that curriculum that she is created already and that gives me a good sense of maybe what i could do in the future if i choose to homeschool", "but again i am so thankful for her", "and i i", "she is", "she is been like an angel honestly", "and i could honestly cry like when she is teaching my son and the other class", "i want to cry she is just such an amazing person", "and i it makes me rest respect teachers so much", "and i do not know why i am getting emotional", "i am like i applied myself in college", "but i struggled in elementary school and junior high", "and i wish i had a little bit of a better education and", "my parents were very overwhelmed with life which i totally understand", "and you know it is hard to balance everything as a parent and", "i am trying to find that every single day", "but my child is education my children is", "education is important to me so while oliver is doing his school while he is in zoom i am trying to keep isaiah busy with puzzles you know basic kind of shapes things like that", "that is what we are working on since he is still preschool age and having a lot of outdoor time for them to run around", "get some fresh air", "and they are also you know doing age appropriate chores throughout the day to help keep their rooms clean help us clean up after meals and help out with easy chores around the farm things they like too like feeding the animals giving the animals water putting you know the compost bucket and the compost things like that", "so that is", "kind of what our routine looks like", "right now we are done with school at around 1 30 and then it is pretty much kind of free time we do quiet time after lunch", "we do school until lunch time we do lunch time", "we have quiet time that is a time for oliver to read while isaiah takes a nap and that usually lasts two or three hours that gives me a chance", "well two three is kind of like", "that is a really good nap that is when i have time to do the things i need to do like film videos um if i want to take free time i use that time to try to get my me time in", "and then once they are up we are gonna start getting to the second half of the day when we are spending time outside", "and we are gonna start getting and moving towards dinner",

bedtime routine", "and then we are to sleep at eight o clock and the same thing starts over the next day so trying to keep our sanity and do a good job balancing everything", "and i wanted to do this video i wanted to share with you guys what our routine has been looking like", "but i would love to hear a little bit about your routine", "and i think that is it that was pretty quick", "but i should

loud so that is why are the first ones that get fed because they are the loudest and it literally sounds like they are screaming mom in the morning", "mom mom", "i", "my kids have breakfast i feed the cats", "and then as soon as i walk outside the goats let me know that they are ready for food", "and then i feed the dogs because the dogs are actually pretty patient", "patiently wait their turn to get fed so that is of course always the first thing that i do in the morning messy hair", "pretty much woke up but chores are the first thing to get done even before we come inside and get ready for our schooling and all the other things that we do during the day which i will do a day in the life video very soon sharing kind of like a full day and what that looks like once everyone is fed i can quickly move on to whatever chores i need to get done for the day which today i needed to begin harvesting our fall crop we had lots of pumpkins", "i had some seeds left over from last year", "so i had some decorative pumpkins as well that i planted", "but you actually can eat any of the pumpkins but the smaller ones we use mostly for decoration", "and we like to give them away as gifts back in the summer", "we planted baby pumpkins jack o lantern pumpkins fairy tale", "but we decided it was time to harvest all of the pumpkins and then pull the plant itself so once we harvest the pumpkins we pull the plant we put that in the compost", "and then we can plant again next summer for our fall season hopefully", "next year we will be on time throughout the summer and into the fall months we grew several hundred pounds of watermelon", "it was amazing", "we had lots of fresh watermelon juice lots of watermelon", "we were able to gift them to neighbors friends", "they are phenomenal

showed in our barn how we have a seller with about five or six boxes full of butternut squash acorn squash and pumpkins that we have harvested throughout the season thus far so", "with today is harvest", "specifically i am gonna use some of it to decorate", "and then we can always cook with it if we want because my front porch is shaded so you know if i start to feel like it is gonna go bad", "i can always take it and use it actually which is great so that is the fun thing about growing pumpkins you can display them for a time", "and then you can cook with them if you want", "and we eat so much squash and pumpkin until february after you harvest them most of them have an incredibly long shelf life", "and they last like", "last year we had squash until february", "and so that is why do lots of soups and roasted squash and pumpkin but for now i we actually did not get footage of me harvesting the other baby pumpkins these more striped darker colored pumpkins", "so these are going to be fun to give away as gifts and", "i am also just going to leave a basket at my front door", "so anybody who wants to take one is free to take well however many they want", "and it is always fun to give it away or donate", "but also we eat so much of what we grow when we lived in the city", "i used to get cravings to eat out at different restaurants all the time", "and now my cravings

video that every year around the end of summer we have several trees on our property that need to be trimmed because they can be pretty dangerous", "we have a eucalyptus tree that the branches start to fall off", "and they are several hundred pounds so if an animal or one of our children is underneath them it could be very very dangerous", "and so we take that seriously and we try to stay on top of trimming our trees the nice thing about that", "is we have plenty of wood for the next year", "so we were actually moving our wood from where it was trimmed", "it is we have been meaning to get around to this", "and we use the tractor and then stacking it for next year", "so it has to season for the next year", "but we actually have wood from the previous year and now every year we have wood", "and we can cook more in our fireplace or outside during the winter months use less propane", "so it is nice to have trees on your property that you harvest properly that you cut down appropriately", "and then we are getting started on our fall chores i am going to share a full outdoor chore video as well because this video would have been long if i shared all of our chores we are in southern california", "so sometimes our temperatures do go down to freezing", "but we do not have to winterize the same way that other folks have to", "but we recently wanted to organize our hoses

on it", "anymore", "so i am doing it myself here if i want to get a good pedicure i do like to do a legit foot bath", "and today i am actually going to use one of our pacific times cbd bath bombs", "and i am going to quarter it", "so i am going to cut it into fours", "the bath bombs contain 100 milligrams of hemp cbd which is actually pretty mild for most but by cutting them in a quarter you can save a little money since cbd bath bombs tend to be a little bit more elevated in their price", "and then i have the left over here", "i am actually going to put that in my foot soak this", "is actually a large bowl from the kitchen with some river rocks that i washed from outside and your feet through the pores in your feet", "you can actually absorb the benefits of the essential oils and the cbd through your feet so even if you ca not do a full soak in cbd", "you can do a foot soak and still have the benefit this is perfect for after a long day on your feet if your feet are feeling swollen and tired and", "the thing i love about doing a spa day at home is you know it is not someone else doing it for you", "but you do not have to drive", "and you can get right back to your life right after you are done pampering i love a good spa moment", "but i have never been a fan of the price tag of going to the spa", "and i have always felt like i could give that experience to myself at home of course with the help of a few fun gadgets that i have collected over the years some beautiful essential oils and whatever i can use for my garden", "i mean you do not need gadgets", "sometimes i keep it simple and sometimes i like to add a few fun facial treatments or mani pedi basically treat it like a spa menu", "maybe just have a little extra treatment for one pampering day over another", "so anyway i just wanted to share with you today", "i hope you enjoyed", "this video be sure to subscribe to my channel and look out for new videos coming soon", "and i will see you guys in the next video bye you"], "6I9x_n2MQak": ["finally sitting down to", "uh we have been talking about sitting down doing videos together pretty much since well since we moved here", "it is been a long time we kind of we have been busy raising a family and doing a lot of stuff outside landscaping farming gardening raising animals kind of getting our life in order when we started youtube living in an apartment to now kind of having this farm if you will", "how did that happen how did that basically from apartment to rented home and then now to bought home", "and we have a lot more land than i was anticipating", "but with that comes", "i feel like a responsibility", "and so when we bought this place two different options you know you can slowly kind of work your way into that lifestyle", "or you can kind of take it by the horns and go crazy with it if it is something that you enjoy in it", "i found that i have i enjoy it a lot i love being outside", "i love working with food on a different scale because i am i love food in the kitchen", "but you get a different sense of the culinary world when you are outside when we were looking for a house", "and we had a budget we started originally kind of in the la area", "not a lot of land options we were just kind of looking for a backyard we knew we were thinking about having kids to think of having a lifestyle in la where we would have a big house and property", "i did not ever dream that up i always hoped i would be able to afford a nice home", "but we looked for years", "and then we looked really hardcore for nine months a long time sometimes two or three times during the week", "and i would say at least you know solid nine months or a year of looking", "so that is why were picky too we", "there was a lot of we did not like it", "or we knew that we did not have any additional budget or we had to kind of this", "is our budget to buy and this is our budget to do renovation so if we were going to use our budget and and buy it as is with no renovations", "it was one thing", "but then we had an idea", "so that is why are kind of looking at different options for what would work after nine months of a lot of we even made offers on several different homes of different sizes", "different price points", "a lot of a lot of this was the first house that really accepted our offer and at our at our what we you know what we offer basically what we offer", "and so this was by far the most land out of everything that we had been looking for well", "and what is what is funny is like", "when i saw the place um the house had a square footage in minus like the max", "i wanted to you know deal with", "and then the land i did not even think about being able to own this much land so that was when i saw the house", "and i saw the property i am an idea guy", "so i am always like i can make this work", "but it was definitely overwhelming and something we were not expecting", "and i was", "i was pregnant with our second child and we did go into this going you know", "three acres for a lot of people is not is not actually a lot right for some of you maybe uh who grew up on land but for us we just were we were like", "can we do", "can we do a good job with this land", "what can we do with this guys like city kids", "i guess of course we had vision", "we were", "we have the idea of what would look cool", "but could we actually execute it ourselves", "so that was", "kind of i feel in a way fate", "i mean", "and when you when you say ourselves without a lot of hired help", "i mean there is been a few projects that i have had an extra hand on", "but um i am not the best craftsman in the world", "but i try", "and you know i try to get my angles right and try to you know have the screws set tight and it is been a work in progress and we do 99 9 of the stuff", "ourselves", "he had a small garden on our balcony in our apartment in the apartment", "we had like these this awkward dinner", "do you remember the dinner table we had", "we got we bought it from your neighbor", "your mom is neighbor", "it was like it was a super awkward dinner table", "it was like this giant table in a small apartment", "and we made it work for a while", "but eventually we got rid of the table", "was it that light beige", "okay", "and i turned the chairs upside down because some were broken i used the chairs basically as like a basin for my my herb garden because i when i was when i started working at kitchens and started using fresh herbs", "i", "i got it", "i am still this way where i have a hard time not using like", "if i am going to use thyme i would much rather use fresh thyme than dry time or same with rosemary parsley all these other herbs", "so i i started to fashion a apartment balcony herb garden and it worked out", "but that was like the first time i got a chance to experience growing something", "and i i do not think i ever stopped right once i started growing my parsley and oregano and all that stuff i always had something growing uh whether it was an herb or a vegetable or a fruit tree after that point once i got started", "i did not feel like i naturally had a green thumb", "or you know i was", "but we will go on to maybe talk about this later", "how i do not know that anybody naturally has a green thumb it is sort of something you totally learn over time", "but i was just kind of like cool", "that is his thing like he is a chef", "he is the garden", "and i was distracted with clothes and music and skin care and all that stuff", "and and obviously enjoying the benefits of having a garden i started to get a lot more into it when we moved into our rental home", "we lived on a beautiful lake", "we had a few trees and pots", "and then we had like a little terrarium and that is i started getting more into it", "then where i was like", "oh this is cool", "and then we started talking about maybe trying to find a bigger backyard where we could you know try to plant have a backyard because the lake house had like kind of a bizarre backyard we did not have a backyard we did not have a yard", "it was all bricks", "and then it was a walkway down to the lake and", "there was even if we had bought that place", "there was not much gardening space and there was some complications with with it being a man made lake and what they the the maintenance involved", "but i grew it out of a necessity like i was obsessed with herbs", "and i hated they were", "they are really", "they were even more expensive but 10 years ago", "13 years however long ago that was 13 years ago", "the apartment i did not want to go to the store and buy a little herb packet for 2 50 or 3", "and then it goes bad the next day because herbs are that fragile", "even if it is a hearty herb we had brought over some of our herb garden which was in those pots from the rental house we started the herb garden", "and then we started expanding from that point on", "and it is been", "what three years so three and a half years it is a little over three years", "and i do not even know how many trees we plan on maybe a hundred trees not", "a hundred seventy something trees especially with the ones that you can if i count the ones that did not make it", "and then you know a garden bed that we have uh four garden beds you know", "12 by six", "and then a big old garden over here that is called the big garden that is like uh 40 by 100 or something like that which is growing", "it is beautiful we are trying to focus on and some of the plans that we have involved because we are doing some terracing they have a big whole rose garden out in front that was this year is project along with some like a long lavender bed there is there is two kind of two parts garden farming aspect of what we had to learn if you wanted to fill the space because it is either a garden grass or pasture or a combo of both to fill the property because when we moved in i definitely did not want to be especially where we live", "it is very dry out here during the summer months", "and so all you are kind of doing is staring at all this open dry dirt land and", "which is great", "it is fun for your kids to run around", "and you know take advantage of it in that way", "it is also like if you have it in you", "but i wanted i know what i wanted similar to the herb garden", "that like obsession that i had i saw an opportunity to solve a problem aesthetically you know you start planting things that green looks good and then two you gain from that", "so you get the landscape", "or i call it farmscaping or gardenscaping", "and you get a beautiful piece a section of your property that is growing", "and you if you do it", "right", "you get something from that", "so the roses you can make a lot of fun things with roses plus they are beautiful plus it fills an area", "so you kind of start to think this way", "or i started to think this way once i started to plant a few of the fruit trees that i had brought from our rented home", "and so it kind of sparked an idea of", "like all right", "well if i keep planting fruit trees it is going to look prettier", "it is going to yield more", "it is going to create a different environment", "you know i feel like that", "was something i can get on board with especially along", "it is a very long term plan because trees and landscaping or farmscaping on this level takes five six seven years for you to see the fruits of your labor in a meaningful way and", "then other people can see it too", "it is kind of an inspiring thing i follow a bunch of gardeners farmers now", "whereas before i have followed a bunch of chefs", "and i still follow chefs", "but they tend to be more on the like chef gardening farming side of life more inclusive more sustainable way of thinking of it where it is like the chef is the gardener or the farmer", "what we love about this is it extends hospitality that much further when you have abundance", "you can share it with others and there is there is something really beautiful about that you know we hope to get to that it is more still in the test phase a little bit", "but um that is definitely the heart of our work in this house", "and you know if we can grow if we can make it a standard to grow a sufficient amount for our own family then from that", "like i said earlier you start to get it gets more abundant every year", "if you are taking care of it this grows doubles and triples and quadruples if you", "if you are maintaining it people ask us is this your forever home", "and i do not think that we know if it is", "i would like our neighbors to be our neighbors", "asked us at the other day um", "and i would love", "this is definitely a forever home way bigger than i ever thought i was gonna get in my life", "and now i have it", "and it is", "like this is the type of home you can make really amazing", "it takes a lot a lot a lot of hard work and a lot of learning new things i did not learn as a kid things that i should have learned probably a little more about tools what they do different types of tools building squaring things up uh having a plan before you execute things getting sore you know things like like you know getting sore from working hard not from playing hard", "so those are the types of things that with this house", "or you know property even an acre half acre or any house where you are doing the work", "you you naturally learn these things", "so i realized the things i should have been paying attention to as a kid that i could have benefited from now", "but now i have that mindset of like focusing on the things that help me as a person um", "i agree so the forever forever home forever well", "and i completely agree", "so i think we would love to live here forever", "but we live in california", "we have we talk about moving out of the state sometimes just because it is much more expensive to live here", "we could do what we are doing here for you know much less expensive somewhere else", "we talk about wanting to experience another state because we have you know grown here", "you know we have grown up and lived here and", "this is all we pretty much know i d love to experience a different place of living a different type of land so that is why talk about it", "but for now we are here", "i think even if we moved to a different state we would still continue some form of this lifestyle definitely forever", "i always want to have a garden for the rest of my life just the experience it is so incredibly therapeutic", "i love to like to hear the kids talk about compost", "they know", "like i did not that was not in my vocabulary as a child at all and to hear our kids", "oh", "that compost that is biodegradable that is not biodegradable", "they know it", "and it is not not in like a snobby way", "they know it because of their life it is second hand to them now cause we talk about a lot and seeds and like identifying different seeds and knowing what different things are like picking from the tree and", "just that experience is really is beautiful as a mother", "and i really love to see it and i", "in some ways wish i had that connection to nature as a child", "so we love it", "and i think we will always have some form of connection in nature whether we are here in this spot or not we got the goats which um we do not process our animals", "we do not uh we are not harvesting animals", "i mean i butchered lots of chickens", "you know that were already you know plucked a lot of stuff in in culinary school and a bunch of different restaurants", "so i i could do", "i definitely could do it", "but i do not think it is something that we want to do it", "is not something that we really want to do", "i mean i love our eggs", "i love the goats we would like to have milk i talked about this a little bit on instagram because with goats they do produce an abundance of milk in abundance in addition to what their kids need so", "i think our thing is we do not really want to get our goats pregnant", "you know we do not want to breed no", "no i want a goat to be", "we want our goats to live a life of a goat so if they get pregnant once or twice that is fine", "but it is not", "this is not something we are gonna be forcing on our animals", "we are not gonna be like all right", "you gotta give us milk all year long all the time we are gonna let them be goats and take care of them and their manure makes for great compost because they add a lot of nitrogen and the compost benefits from it but also", "the you know obviously the garden benefits from that", "and so that is why are going to try to give them pasture in the next year so that they have a bigger ranging space we love their company", "you know we enjoy the chickens and their eggs and the kids interacting with all the animals they are always offering you nutrients for your plants and never ever stop so", "the chicken manure and the goat manure", "they both offer something different like goat manure they are called neat pellets or neat manure because they they uh they poop very organized like little rabbit poops but bigger and so", "that is why can use that directly on plants you ca not do that with chicken manure you have to compost chicken manure it is a little too hot with nitrogen but", "these animals are always offering something whether it is from poop or food", "it becomes a beautiful ecosystem as well that we we share i think on a healthy farm you are a homestead you are sharing with your animals", "and you are", "it is like it is honorable harvest", "we give them from our garden and then again like he said if they happen to become pregnant once or twice in their life and they have an abundance of milk beyond what they are feeding their kids if the chickens are giving us eggs we are going to give some of them to the other animals because it is good for them", "we are going to give some back to the chickens and we are going to share the reason i say farming is because we i think we have a farm or what some might consider a farm", "but we are not farmers yet although we would love if we continue to live here over the long period of time contribute to our community food wise", "right now we would not call ourselves farmers per se", "no", "definitely like we are starting on the homestead front you know starting on", "you know you know canning pickling preserving conserving", "what you are growing like that is kind of the first steps of homesteading from there it can branch off into a lot of different ways we have we have our way of doing things", "there is this we want to create a cycle where everything is kind of feeding into each other", "you know", "so that is why are not the most efficient in terms of maybe processing our our chickens like", "some other farmers would do that they process their goats they do things where like they have another way of sustenance that we do not partake in so", "but with that i i want to take an extra effort in using the things that some of those folks are not using like the composting like the pellets or like the", "you know the manures", "and like what you have discovered about artichoke the other day that the artichoke stems would make really good packing material um sustainable packing materials", "so we kind of want to think a little bit differently about it", "and we have been studying biodynamic", "if you want to look into the kind of style that we are interested in there is two documentaries that i would just recommend that we liked on netflix just because they are", "so that is why got so popular", "and it is", "it is", "very it is aligned we did not necessarily get our ideas from the documentaries", "but they are aligned with kind of our style what was the biggest uh biggest little phone the biggest little farmer and then kiss the uh is it crisp", "the ground", "it is about soil", "and it is about regenerative and biodynamic farming", "there is a lot of books as well on biodynamic farming and basically not mono mono crop farming but growing a lot of different things", "bio", "i think it is biodiverse", "it is kind of that", "that is the key word with that one", "this type of rhetoric was not popular", "i d say like", "five or six years ago it is very popular now", "so that is why will hear if you are in tune with nature on any level and farming or gardening on any level", "you will start to hear these biodiversities different types of cultures huge culture horticulture and so that is why start to immerse yourself into it", "learn a little bit more about it", "but we want to we want to have um even though we have some some gaps and the things we do not partake in", "we want to make it a very efficient circle of what we are partaking in you know with the composting", "it is like we are feeding butternut squash to our goats that gave us compost from the year prior you know even though that is the idea", "right", "so", "and it takes time over you know in the biggest little farm", "they are a much bigger farm their operation but it took seven years to create that biodiversity even before we ever saw that documentary we were doing that", "and then we watched it", "and we are like", "oh gosh", "that is that is like our life you know", "the uh having to deal with death on the farm chickens you know predators and having to deal with gophers and some of these different issues and", "how you handle it", "and so we are slowly but surely getting there it is been a beautiful experience", "and you know have not turned this farm into a business quite yet", "that would be a goal of ours i think in the future if we are still here we are still creating content he is still doing content for doing some stuff with food network and youtube and facebook and he is teaching cooking classes before the pandemic happened", "obviously we are having like a little break from some of that", "right i was doing a lot of music stuff again before the pandemic happened that kind of really shifted our focus to here the farm homestead", "i think", "well i think what it did to everyone else", "it did it to us in a way where we are like all", "right now we are here", "we probably should like double down tying up all the little loose ends and there is a lot of ways it can go", "and there is a lot of ways it wo not go", "we are definitely like micro", "i would say you know to two and a half three acres is pretty small for any type of like gardening farming operation like commercially", "but if you are super super efficient like what i said earlier with the things that you have then you can grow into a micro commercial market we could have a farm stand but the farm stand could include prepared items like", "if i get a license for my shack i run the sewage i get all that stuff done running water", "then i can actually prepare stuff in my shack to sell at my market", "you could obviously sell all the all the fresh produce", "and then you have different seasons you have different pop ups", "i mean that is with the market stand", "you know use", "like there is like five ideas with inside that central idea and that goes on to a lot of other projects charity projects where the things that we are learning here why would not we want to take that to a place that is desolate somewhere downtown", "and it is a project that went belly up", "and now there is a vacant lot that is doing nothing for anybody you know", "and so that is why could take our knowledge", "apply it to that and grow a lot of food for folks that do not have access to like fresh food from the ground locally", "you know that is the charitable aspect then the double downing on the things that we are already doing here making it efficient so that when we do go out and help other folks that we at least have some grounds and like a sense of what we know what we are doing", "he was doing we were doing pop up restaurants where we would go to different cities and and pop up a restaurant basically we would love to be able to take what we are growing to a pop up restaurant as well", "so there is a lot of things we would love to do in the future having a business running a business from home while trying to raise two children for us", "has been has had its challenges and it is moments where we are not as consistent with uploading", "we are struggling with the balance of it all", "it is also everything all choices that we made and that we wanted for our life", "so i mean byron is have hands on dad", "he is farming changing diapers cooking has a pop up you know teaching a class", "like there is a like every other family", "it is always that balance", "you figure it out i mean", "and that is the thing whether you are if you are married or you have kids or your dad or your mom or whatever", "like you kind of have", "hopefully you have the ability to step back measure your environment and say how can i best like with the skills that i have been taught in life how can i best apply it to this situation to make it better for everybody", "and so like i think day to day that is all we are trying to figure out like she is doing", "she is like all right", "i can do this", "i am going to do this", "well i am going to focus on that let is get it done and then learn two other new things", "so the next day is a little bit better and kind of keep adding along", "that so last i do not know since we had oliver it is been that type of learning process", "it comes with its ups and downs just like anything else so and trying to support each other because we are both very creative", "we both have a lot of ideas try to support each other with what we are interested in and and um share the burdens of life with each other", "and i think that that is", "what we like that is how we view marriage and relationships and so anyway that is a long story short how we ended up on a farm and why we are doing what we are doing", "and we thought we would do a video to put this out there in case anybody is curious about why and where we stand and and everything and this is not even everything", "i mean no", "this is kind of scatterbrained learn new things and", "if they are good share them with you guys that is all i wanted it is like the foundation of both of our youtube channels", "you know of course we have different types of channels but", "the idea behind both of them is learning new things and if those new things work share them with folks who can then do the things that work", "yep", "i love it", "right boom there", "you go", "i think we tied that into a perfect little knot appreciate you guys watching", "and i guess we will see you very soon we are hoping to film together more in the future this will be a goal for us a little tricky", "so anyway we appreciate you guys and we will see you very soon in the next video later folks"], "UKkjytotwog":

those days when i need to slow down relax and just take a beat to have some self care", "it is pretty rare that i can do that in the middle of the day unless i am not feeling well so most of the time it is at night", "but i thought i would share a day and night version and also share some of what i do on those days when i do need some self care over the last few years we have definitely made a lifestyle transition", "and it is been amazing", "i mean the longer that i live here and work with the land my self care routine in practice is performed through a different lens than it was before", "and also what i seek to create and use for both beauty and wellness has shifted and changed as i have connected with nature more and i am so thankful for that journey because i used to look heavily to the outside world and media for inspiration on what it meant to look and feel beautiful and as i interact more with nature and animals and", "i feel closer to it", "my lens on what it means to be beautiful has shifted pretty significantly my idea of self care is constantly evolving and changing the shift for me is moving in a more holistic approach for overall wellness and self care", "this season of my life is active with two young children and plenty of chores but i do have days during the month when i do not feel well or i might be coming down with something or it is close to that time of the month that i am achy", "so i love to make a cup of tea from herbs in the garden as i study and understand herbs more i can choose what is appropriate for whatever it is that i am feeling whether it is exhausted or body aches or maybe a cough or sniffles", "also i like to make some beautiful self care from what i am growing", "so today i am actually going to make some rose water the key with this is not letting it come to a boil so letting it get to the right temperature and then letting it cool down", "i add it with a little witch hazel to a spray bottle", "i am also going to make some calendula body butter with a combination of mango butter shea butter beeswax and some calendula tincture that i made from calendula in my garden", "now i can touch a little bit more on these specifics in future videos", "i am going to do a video on tea", "and i am also going to talk a little bit more about tincture in the future but for now i am going to give a brief overview and i will put some information in the description if you are interested", "i grow calendula because it is incredibly healing to the skin it can be used for bath time body butters", "it is gentle enough for children so for diaper rash for both tea and skin care you can use fresh and dried herbs drying herbs", "is great for long term storage", "today i actually picked some sage from the garden", "i am gonna put that in a bowl with some of the dried lavender and dried roses that i have in my cabinet", "and i am gonna put some hot water over that and do a facial steam", "this is a facial and actually it is a great lung steam", "as well we have had a lot of fires i have been struggling with some allergies so the sage and thyme that i put in there fresh from the garden", "is gonna be great to breathe in so taking deep breaths i usually put a towel over my head just take nice slow deep breaths", "this is great if you are not feeling good to do a facial steam it can kind of help clear things out", "but it is also great for your skin as well when you need self care a bathing ritual is so wonderful", "i mean there are so many proven benefits to bathing in general bath bombs", "have always

bath bombs i am going to share more info on how this brand came to be and why i am so excited about it in the description", "so that is why can read some more details but each bath bomb comes in this compostable box for our first collection of bath bombs", "i wanted to share my personal favorite essential oil blends for a targeted effect during your bath time", "this is revive", "this is orange and langling this combination of essential oils", "is one of my favorites for the day time when i need basically to be revived i am not feeling", "well i need to be uplifted this combo uplifts the mood and calms the mind and is fantastic for the skin i also created restore which is orange black pepper and frankincense for the day or evening", "but this one i like specifically when i am not feeling well when i feel like i need an immunity boost", "and i want to feel better overall rest", "is that oh so lovable combination of chamomile and lavender perfect for when you want to chill and zen out in the bath and then last but certainly not least is relax which is", "lavender chamomile and frankincense frankincense is included in two of the bath bombs", "and i think most of us are

start experiencing true fall for several weeks", "but as we make our way towards daylight savings on november 1st shifting the season and of course harvesting everything that we had planned for our fall garden and as the season progresses i have plenty of chores both indoors and outdoors to get ready for the next season", "so today i am getting started with indoor chores and some decorating most of the pumpkins", "are not quite ready to harvest because i was a little behind on planting them in the summer", "i did harvest two of the miniature", "the jacko little white pumpkins which i love", "and then we actually had to harvest a very large portion of our pumpkins early this year because a gopher got to the plant so we still have a lot of different varieties coming fairy tale jack o lanterns", "the mini ones we planted several different varieties", "so we should have a pretty large harvest this year almost like a pumpkin patch which will be fun", "this is where we keep our butternut squash our different squash varieties and our pumpkins", "it is an area in the barn that is sort of cold and dark", "and we use it as a seller they have a great shelf life as a matter of fact last year they lasted through january february", "it was crazy we were cooking with them all throughout the winter season soups and all sorts of great recipes", "so i brought a few in to display them in the house until we cook with them", "and then i am going to start by dusting and reaching areas that i do not get to as consistently with my cleaning routine", "i try to get to each of these areas a few times each season", "and i start from the top down so obviously when i am dusting i am going to get some dust on the table and on the floors", "so i am going to clean from the top down", "we have a lot of trees on our property and some of them can be quite dangerous if they are not trimmed regularly so that is why usually do this in the summer which prepares us with wood for the next year", "so that is why do let the wood cure outside", "we have quite a bit of it out there curing at the moment i did bring some in to put near our fireplace", "this wood is clean there is no bugs or spiderwebs", "so i am gonna bring it in and put it on display but keep a close eye on it just to see if i have any trouble with insects because i would not want that", "so i just brought in all the clean logs that i could find again", "gonna keep a close eye on this", "but i feel like this area is begging for wood", "and i had plenty to display", "so i brought that in for now", "and i will keep you posted on how that goes", "my mantle is sort of random in the summer", "sometimes i do not even have anything on there this summer", "we had a globe on there", "we were looking at the globe a lot with oliver", "so i am cleaning up the fireplace mantle", "and i am going to slowly start to bring in my fall decor", "but i am going to keep it pretty simple this year", "i love these flameless birch candles that i got at hobby lobby", "a few years ago i also have some of the heirloom corn that our neighbors grew they gave it to us to collect the seeds so we could grow it next year", "but i am also going to display some", "and then i will save the seeds after the season is over", "and i am going to display the baby pumpkins of course from the garden we can use those as well for soup", "or however we decide to use them in the future", "then i am going to vacuum the entire area that is the fireplace which tends to get dirty dusty and like i said i am going to keep a close eye on this area for spider webs and bugs because this area is in our living room and dining room", "so i like to keep it as clean as possible usually at the end of the season when we are no longer using the fireplace we give it a nice clean and throughout the season we clean it out pretty regularly so it does not smell", "and then i give it a clean right before we start using it again also another thing that i like to do transitioning into new seasons", "is to clean all the windows", "sometimes there is a flyer two or three that gets stuck in the windows and some dust and making sure i touch on the entire house now", "i do not always get it done in one day", "so usually it is over the course of several days or weeks that i can get to all of these areas of the house but making sure to touch these areas a few times per season and definitely going into the next season", "we also replaced the filters in our air vents every six months", "and then i like to get up to the vents and vacuum any dust at the turn of the season as well", "so these are not things i do every time i clean my house", "you know the house definitely gets cluttered and messy between the animals and the kids", "so it definitely does not always look perfect as i say in all of my cleaning videos um", "but you know we do our best to try to upkeep and take good care of our house as best as we can even though it does not stay", "so that is", "why 24 hours a day seven days a week so the next thing that i have to do is just a general clean of the living room at this season of my life", "i do not have that many rugs in my home at the moment it does get pretty dusty where we live all of our neighbors", "are ranchers they have horses", "there is a lot of dust that gets kicked up", "and it does end up in the house",

under regularly", "but this one gets cleaned very consistently because it collects everything i do not move my couch at the turn of the season", "but i always move my couch at the turn of the season so whenever i am doing a deep cleanse i do move the couch i took a little break to facetime the boys with byron as they are at my mom", "is house which we are so thankful for her because we can get so much work done both on the farm and whatever work we need to catch up on when she watches them there are always fun surprises to find behind the couch from socks to toys to dog toys to little crummies", "so i try to get back there often", "but i do not know if you can relate to who knows what is under slash behind the couch most of the time until we get to it", "i get a lot of questions about this couch", "this couch was a custom made couch from a local couch store near us", "and i honestly ca not even remember the name of the couch store because i think i had given birth", "and my mind was super foggy my husband", "and i had been looking into the cloud couch from restoration hardware", "but we had seen a lot of mixed reviews plus", "it was expensive so this one kind of had a similar look but was not nearly as expensive", "so we designed it to kind of be similar to what the cloud couch looked like", "but not exactly of course", "and then i am just putting simple decorations on the coffee table cleaning the coffee table giving it a little oil just to kind of freshen it up and the decorations probably wo not last very long on that table to be honest because i will have to move it for the kids eventually", "but we have it there for the time being", "so then i am continuing with the windows i am going to wash the windows and clean them i am on the phone with my mother in law so always getting a little chit chatting in while i am cleaning the house", "but i have to do a several passes on these windows because they get super super dirty", "and it is very streaky", "so it is going to take me a little bit to get the windows nice and crystal clean", "every year my display on the table is a little different and i like to have fun with it", "but i change it up for the holidays as well", "but i always like to have a simple fall display on the table", "and it will change depending on which flowers are blooming in the garden", "and i can add or adjust it as the season goes on", "but i actually brought some of the pumpkins and just displaying it on the table for now until we decide to cook it", "so the goal is to clean all of the windows in the guest room the kids room and finally i make it back to my bedroom", "and then i will clean my studio last", "but just basically doing the same thing in each room so kind of boring to see it in every single room but making it back to the bedroom and also just bringing out candles from the previous year i will not be buying any more fall candles for next year", "i am going to try to stick with some more natural options in the future", "but i have candles from last year that i am going to burn until they are finished", "and it does make the house smell absolutely amazing this time of the year i also like to do closet purging toy box purging", "sometimes i will list things on poshmark that i d no longer wear consistently i usually do a donation as well although from my understanding the last few times i have tried to donate currently you cannot donate any items because of kovid", "so i do have a few items i am posting to my poshmark", "and i do this about once a year kind of go through my closet", "if something is not fitting quite right", "or i do not feel like i am using it", "i will usually you know list it", "i am trying not to buy as many clothes these days in general and", "if i do i try to stick with more you know", "vintage or pre loved items because i often end up loving those and wearing those the most anyway and keeping the items that i really love in my closet and

quite to the six month mark", "yet", "so i ca not tell you if it lasts six months", "but i can definitely tell you that it has changed our mindset about using paper towels with some of these things it does take a shift in your habits so instead of just constantly grabbing for a new paper towel you take one you can wash it and hang it to dry you can use one or two in the kitchen at a time you can also collect dirty ones and wash them on a gentle low load in your washer but using obviously less because you are trying to make it last longer", "here i have a solid that is and also a dish scrubber that i got in my package from the earthlings", "co", "i mentioned them in my less waste bathroom video because i also use their bamboo toothbrush and their shampoo and conditioner bars which i love to be honest", "i was not sure if i was going to like the dish soap solid", "but i have been liking it", "and it is pretty easy to keep clean the brush is really sturdy it does not fall apart", "and it works really great in my less waste bathroom video i mentioned wanting to make my own soap buying castle soap and bulk", "and then i bought this on amazon", "it comes with two mason jars and four of the tops", "now i am finishing up a bottle of castle soap that i have", "but you can also buy it in bulk", "you want to fill the container a quarter of the way with", "castel castles very concentrated the rest is water", "and then i put a little bit of olive oil in mine to soften my hands for the kitchen", "and then you got", "a great foaming hand cleanser", "the castile soap already had lavender", "so this is the lavender olive oil but in the fall we will make some fun cleansers i was on the hunt for a biodegradable sponge scrubber for the kitchen", "so that is why stick this one in water", "it expands it works fantastic for scrubbing the you know different pans and things when i need a little extra help", "and it is also compostable so speaking of compost and why i am kind of trying to transition is my journey with composting and this is my compost bucket", "we keep it in the kitchen", "we do have to dump it every day because it does attract flies and start to smell this", "is leftover kitchen scraps old flowers that went bad fruit that was bad coffee grounds and of course you know packaging that is compostable", "so i try to fill that up if i deem it trash that can decompose i will put it in my compost pail", "take it out to the compost and then clean the pail when i come back inside so that is how we add kitchen scraps to our compost", "and i have a video a few videos back", "i think it is called the farm is growing where we talk more about our compost itself the next switch up is being more consistent with making my household cleansers my kids like oranges and tangerines", "so i save the leftovers i have tons of rosemary in my front yard", "so i am going to cover this completely with vinegar", "then i am going to cover the top of the jar with cheesecloth i like to let the vinegar infuse for a few days to a week so that footage was from a week ago on my iphone", "and then you want to strain out the rosemary and", "whatever peel very very well", "so it is just infused vinegar", "if it is infused vinegar", "it is going to have a very good shelf life six months to up to a year but always look at it", "there is no mold and if you do have leftover debris from the rosemary and it floats to the top that oxygen will allow it to mold so that is why always want to keep a close eye on your cleansers", "but they should have a pretty decent shelf life i used to use a cleaner for my floors from method you could order it online or get it from target", "but i recently switched to about a half a cup to a cup of vinegar depending on how much water i have so", "if i have a gallon of water i will usually do a half a cup of vinegar and some type of essential oil blend in the summer lavender and lemon is nice and the winter clove and orange is nice i do like to add", "a few drops of unscented castel soap too much definitely makes the floors sticky so a little tiny bit is plenty", "and then my floors are actually tile not hardwood", "but they look like hardwood", "so i treat it like i do uh you know", "like i would with tile clean it with a mop", "so i decided to try these beeswax wraps or covers they kind of conform a little bit",

think about wrapping it in plastic and putting it in our refrigerator", "so this seemed like an option that we would try and see how it goes over time if you have any better suggestions i d love to know", "but right now that is kind of our switch up for the moment it has been a bit of a journey to change up our coffee routine we have been talking about it for years and my husband always liked french press but some mornings especially when the kids were little", "we went for that convenience with the keurig we finally decided", "you know we are dumping this", "and we are gonna buy in bulk",

a tincture and making apple cider vinegar", "these are things i have been looking into and studying for years", "and i took a herbal academy of course", "i think it was two years ago", "and again it is been a process of slowly transitioning to the things that i feel like i could do and", "right here i am actually taking from when i made the time and lime bathroom cleanser", "i kept the strained thyme and lime put those in ice cube trays covered with vinegar", "you can drop one of those into your disposal", "run some water turn it on and it makes your disposal smell good", "so there are some easy ways to instead of i like candles you know especially in the fall", "but just having your house smell nice and fresh without having to use anything from the store lemons have so many great uses around the house", "and i love to take a lemon and cut it in half coarse salt", "is a great option and this works great for cleaning up a stove top", "and i know i have shared this before on my channel but sharing it again in case", "you missed it", "it is a great easy way to clean something that needs an abrasive cleanse", "and honestly i used to do this when i was in a pinch when i did not have what i needed to clean it", "so this quickly became a go to scrubber now of course after you have cleaned with most of these things your kitchen is going to already smell pretty good", "but something i like to do is simmer a pot of herbs and fruit", "it is different depending on the time of the year this time of the year i like to do rosemary and lemon", "it is always great to have a clean kitchen to have it smell nice and know that everything can go right back into the earth and it does not harm us or the soil", "so something that i am trying to continually move towards and learning every day", "and it is not about perfection", "but it is about being aware and making small changes over time please share your tips with me as well as i love the community online and

ingredients from the garden", "this one is very easy", "it is just a bunch of thyme from the garden i have some lime peel of course", "i use the inside of the lime and save to the outside cover that in vinegar and then put that in a mason jar", "let that sit some articles and websites and things on pinterest will suggest letting this sit for several weeks i personally do not like to do that

and peels", "and i am actually going to put the rest of the vinegar and that in some ice cube trays i stick that in the freezer i am going to show that in an upcoming video where i do a version of this but in the kitchen", "but right now we are going to stick with the bathroom", "so i made the lemon in time", "and then i also on this day made a rosemary and orange for the kitchen so basically the same thing i took orange peels and rosemary either or will work for either space", "and you can experiment with a lemon if you wanted to or lime or even essential oils", "i think in the fall i will do the combination of the orange peel", "and actually i will put some clove in there", "so it has a little bit more spice", "so i will probably do that in the fall months but for now i am going to use the lime and thyme in the bathroom", "i am just going to spray it on the base of the bathtub inside the bathtub", "clean it out but it can be used for anything for the counters i use it for the glass for the mirrors in the past i have used different cleaners for different parts of the house", "and although you can definitely do that i have learned it is easier and less wasteful to use infused vinegar whether it is essential oils or herbal infused vinegars to clean multiple areas of the house and you can use it for so many different things whether it is countertops", "or you can also use it in a mop bucket", "so i could put some vinegar and herbal infusion or essential oils in there and clean the floors the bases of the bathroom you can also use it in the interior of your shower for the walls with a scrubber works great for that as well", "can i tell you a little secret my bathtub is mostly used by my three and six year old", "i do not especially in the summer do not really take baths very often", "i think i did a video recently on taking a cool bath which is still pretty rare in the summer but that can be a nice an herbal cooling bath in the summer", "is pretty much the thing i d even consider especially since lately it is been so so hot here in california", "but i will look around at my bathroom and", "i will see when it is starting to need a deep clean so around the base and the bottom of the bathtub which gets pretty dusty and just over by my vanity", "it was about three years ago that i made this wood tray for my bathtub", "it was super easy", "i could not find one actually to purchase", "that was the right measurements", "so i ended up making one myself with one piece of wood and then two smaller pieces of wood on the bottom there to create the legs and i love to have this as a display on my bathtub", "but of course i have to take it off every time the boys take a bath in my most recent summer self care video i made these diy bath salts with herbs and flowers from the garden", "and then epsom salt and some essential oils i like to store these in glass jars on the tray i like to have a display even though i take it away when the kids take a bath so that they have more space and that they do not have an accident i will keep it there when i take a bath so that i can light a candle or have a book there", "it is pretty if you have a deep soak tub which i did not have a deep soaked tub growing up in my home", "i always dreamed of having one", "and i did not have one for many years when my husband and i first got married now that

not work for you so far", "these have been working great for me", "and so i feel like instead of running out to the drugstore or to a nice store to get shampoo", "i am gonna try to do this more consistently and see how i like it over time another simple easy switch that takes a little getting used to but also is easy to switch the whole family over to is bamboo and compostable toothbrushes

between toothpaste from the store and", "this like every other brush you can utilize this it is basically equal parts coconut oil baking soda and a few drops of peppermint oil", "it is easy to make i can put some on my toothbrush usually with a little popsicle stick you can use this along with your toothpaste to kind of reduce your toothpaste use and how often you have to buy a new one but also as an additional refresher as well that is a little bit more of a natural option another switch up that is worth getting used to is bamboo cotton reusable makeup wipes and toner wipes", "so you can wash these", "it comes in a little mesh bag", "the other thing to consider with this switch up is that it is not quite as convenient in the sense that you want to keep track of the pads once you are done using them put them back in the bag and then wash them it is not too hard of a switch up once you get used to it", "these can be used for removing makeup", "but they can also be used with a toner i like to use them with witch hazel or maybe a little coconut oil", "but they are reusable which is great", "and i feel like it is well worth it to keep track of them and wash them another easy and less wasteful switch up", "is to make your own foaming hand cleanser", "so you can get these mason jar foaming soap dispensers or the tops the foaming tops if you already have the mason jars", "but you can find these on amazon as well", "and then you can reuse them over and over again if you buy your castile soap in bulk you can do unscented castle soap and add your own essential oil blends one thing to keep in mind about castile soap", "it is kind of like a concentrate so it can be very strong especially in certain scents like the peppermint", "so please be careful when using it on young children or on yourself", "remember that it is a concentrate and", "right here i have a little less than half a cup", "and then the rest is water", "and if you want you can add a few drops of essential oils and then moving on i am going to be making a room spray", "this is sage and rose it is going to be for the bathroom", "and it is basically a homemade room spray", "i have some dried sage and rose from the garden i added some warm water basically brewing it like a tea", "and then i am going to strain it into a glass spray bottle", "and then i added enough liquid and then as you can see from the shoulder all the way up it is empty in the bottle", "i am going to add witch hazel to the top that is going to act as a preservative and then at the very end i am going to add", "a little extra rose essential

time every day that is monitored so that they do not eat everything they eat the things i want them to eat um and then uh i pay attention to them", "give them lots of snacks", "so when we go out of

captured in this video they live in a chicken tractor which is basically a movable chicken coop", "and you can move them in different areas so that they have shade and that they can scratch different

amazing and", "we had of course leftover rind that we shared with the goats", "and they loved it right here", "you can see it is a little darker in that darker patch", "i planted three rows for fall", "and then i can plant more once i have room", "so once i harvest all of the squash which we have a lot of squash", "and so i am probably gonna can some squash squash has a pretty decent shelf life and there is a lot of different ways to use it", "actually i will use it instead of potatoes like i will do a squash hash with eggs in the morning", "or you know there is a lot of different ways to be creative with it", "but squash we have a lot of it", "and then i go into the rose garden", "i like to check on the roses", "sometimes i even like to pick some of the roses if it is time with roses i usually prune when they bloom so if there is one that looks like it is", "you know it is bloomed and it might have a day or two", "left", "i will usually pick it and put it in a little bouquet inside the house next", "i moved to the herb garden which is the garden that we do not have on irrigation", "so i hand water everything", "and i love the smell", "and i love to harvest what is in the herb garden", "i can pretty much harvest calendula", "every single day so i go out and check my calendula plant", "i can harvest mint and have some mint tea there is a lot of goodness going on in the herb garden", "so i love to spend a little bit of time in there", "finally i am heading over to our other garden", "this is where we have our berries a few different trees we have a lot over here", "but our beds right now are pretty empty", "and so i am kind of raking the soil just kind of loosening it up over there not doing much because what i have to do is i have to amend the soil so for where i am going to plant carrots i want to do", "carrots onions turnips beets there is a few different things i want to plant for the fall", "but i am also waiting till this heat wave path is passed because it is been so crazy hot", "but i can prep in the meantime so for amending the soil i might do a video more specifically on the fall garden", "but i am going to add some sand to our compost because carrots really like that usually i have just enough time to feed the animals", "look around the garden do a little harvesting here and there", "and maybe get a project started before it is time to go inside and wake up the boys now if the boys are not awake by 8", "i will wake them up otherwise sometimes they wake up on their own", "and so i head inside usually so that i am inside when they wake up right now", "i am doing some dishes", "and i also wanted to clean the dog", "is bowls which i do not do every single day because they do not need to be cleaned every day but when i notice that they are starting to get a little gross", "i clean out their water bowl and their bowls so that everybody has fresh clean water containers", "and i do the same for the chickens and goats i like to", "all of their containers are cleaned regularly and obviously that is why i want to have a feet a special feeder for the hay as well to keep everything as clean as possible", "and then it is eight o clock on the dot", "so isaiah was the first to get up", "he is usually my first to rise and so that is why are gonna go wake up oliver gonna have some breakfast", "and then we start school at nine so eight o clock", "gives us enough time to just chat for a little bit", "get some breakfast get dressed and then get over to our little school room where we are doing our distance learning these to the halloween closet", "remember where the paint is", "the dogs have two different water bowls one for inside and one for outside", "so i like to try to clean those up", "so it is been a while that we have been trying to ditch the keurig", "and we have been talking about it for years", "but we obviously enjoyed that convenience", "when our children were younger we recently moved to a french press and we have our ground coffee in these mason jars", "we have got some coconut sugar", "i have some dried tea from the garden", "and so i am just going to put my bouquet and also some fresh mint from the garden right next to where we make the tea and the coffee", "so it is nice in the morning", "and then i am gonna make myself some tea byron usually does french press coffee we have two different kinds i have the four sigmatic the mushroom coffee", "and then just i think like a starbucks ground coffee depending on the morning", "i might have coffee or a few sips of byron is coffee", "but i feel like many mornings", "my body just wants something a little bit more clear something simple", "and i like to drink what is from the garden", "so i have dried a lot of the herbs from the garden", "all right", "so moving on it is around nine o clock", "everybody is dressed and fed and we all have coffee and tea and all the chores are done for the morning", "we started school this week", "so that is why have some fun learning games for isaiah and oliver some face wipes pens and pencils his school provided an ipad for learning", "and then he uses my computer to meet with his teacher", "his grandma made a fun little diy these little apples here", "so when he does a good job listening or when he does a good job on one of his assignments we move one of those over", "and then he can get a treat once they all go over we also have some games", "some fun learning games math and reading and tons and tons of books oliver was in a great public school", "last year we loved his teacher of course we did the distance learning which was kind of more like homeschooling because i was spending several hours working on his homework with him", "and he did not have any interaction with his teacher", "last year they did not tell us what was happening this year until recently", "and so i did have a backup plan to homeschool i was ready to go to kind of pull him out and to sign him up to a homeschool", "but he actually has a teacher assigned and so far it is been great i have been sitting there listening to his lessons", "and she is been fantastic so if you want to hear more about that i can share in a video by itself while he is finishing up school before we get to lunchtime", "i am gonna go give all the animals a little snack", "so any leftover", "you know sometimes my kids do not finish their watermelon or we have leftover lettuce from a dinner", "she is so cute", "so i wanted to give them a nice cool snack", "i will usually keep that in the freezer or the refrigerator and plan to give everybody a little snack so that completes my morning routine if you want to see a little bit of a deeper dive on our distance learning area our um kind of home school desk if you will", "it was a little messy", "but i can show that", "but you know so far so good", "i respect his teacher and i feel like i can learn a lot from her to be honest and to be able to sit there and listen in on the lesson and help him out i respect and appreciate all the teachers and what they are doing", "and it is it is wonderful to be able to have him home but also to know that he is getting a good education so that is why will see what the future holds i may homeschool", "and that was the plan originally", "but so far i am enjoying this", "so anyway i will be back with a new video", "soon thank you so much for watching", "and i will see you guys in the next video bye"], "o0Qv_NrH9d0": ["hey everyone welcome back to my channel", "i am so sorry i have been inconsistent with posting this summer", "i feel like i have been posting a lot and then not posting", "but we got back from albuquerque new mexico we were visiting byron", "is family helping his mom out with her backyard garden which i shared on my instagram but did not get a chance to share here on youtube", "but we are back and", "we had so much work that we had to do when we got back", "and so that is why have been catching up", "i thought i would share with you what we have been up to now", "that we are back getting ready to start homeschooling and we have a lot that we need to do on our property", "i thought that today i would update you on what we have been doing", "and then hopefully i can get back in the swing of things now that we are home", "and we are not going anywhere for a while it can get back into routine and traveling kind of throws it off a little bit", "but i wanted to talk a little bit about compost today some new friends that we have added to our little farm and then also i am harvesting and also planting so planting for fall and harvesting what we have", "right now i got some early pumpkins i am gonna jump right in first and talk a little bit about compost", "i have actually had a lot of questions about our compost which if you do not know what compost is already it is essentially organic matter that has been decomposed in a process that is called composting so basically making your own soil and what we do is obviously when we trim our trees when we have green clippings grass clippings work great for compost kitchen scraps work fantastic for compost", "basically you are kind of just layering all of this", "and then you mix it", "water it", "and you create soil so this process recycles various organic materials otherwise usually regarded as waste products with the proper mixture of carbon nitrogen water and oxygen there are microorganisms that break down organic matter", "and it decomposes and becomes your compost or your soil items that are high in nitrogen", "include grasses weeds plants vegetable waste coffee grounds with under three acres of property", "our compost can actually grow to a pretty decent size and go beyond just supplementing our garden beds but actually becoming our compost our soil that we use and gives us a lot of options for what we can continue to grow", "but you can have a compost no matter", "what size actually one of our biggest goals and priorities right now for our land is to grow our compost as big as we can with what we have on our land", "originally we were actually taking manure from our neighbors cows getting further back green waste including fruit and veggie scraps grass clippings coffee tea", "this will supply the compost with nitrogen which is key for healthy soil brown waste like wood shavings", "ash dry leaves or even paper shopping bags", "is rich in carbon which helps break down the other scraps and a balance of the two is really important so for us it is finding that key balance and really focusing on growing and building healthy soil so me and byron are very much on the same page about this so that is why water and we turn regularly", "we check the temperature of our compost and we are trying to get this baby as big as possible", "we also are going to build a structure and move it", "it is basically going to live inside of a bin that we can still turn it with the tractor so if you are interested in starting a compost you will need a bin that is about three feet in diameter and not much higher than your waste this right here was actually our first compost bin", "it is kind of falling apart now", "but it also had a top i follow a few urban farmers on instagram", "and it is awesome and encouraging to know that you do not have to have big land to start with this process i have always mentioned in my videos that we started on our apartment balcony with a small garden and eventually grew to this", "this is like a meat thermometer because the compost thermometers are really expensive the long ones are like 200 bucks", "anyways this is like 15 or 16 bucks", "i am gonna put it on here", "and i get real deep in", "so i can really see where the compost is cooking", "but it is not that hot", "it needs to be 140 130 at least 130", "the heat", "i mean this will break down but the heat is what speeds up the process because everything breaks down even without heat this gets going fast", "and it cooks out anything bad in there", "i mean if there is anything you can think that could be like kind of weird", "we have been turning it so much let is let it sit for a week", "okay", "and see if it like gets hotter", "let is see if it gets super hot if you are interested in starting a compost", "try to choose a bin with a lid if you are worried about the smell but", "what eventually happens is it decomposes rather fast and the smell quickly turns into soil and it smells just like soil do not forget to give your pile some tender loving care every few weeks check that your compost is getting air and water without these components", "your compost will begin to rot and smell so if it seems dry add a sprinkle of water if your scraps are wet enough you can skip that and then mix it with a shovel or a garden fork and if you are not seeing progress add some green material and keep the pile moist if it is smelly and wet", "you want to add some brown material and turn it more often start small and experiment you can supplement with your own compost in your garden or you can use it completely if you can build a large enough pile we are actually planning to add a lot more on our hill", "so we need as much soil as we can possibly get you can see here we are doing a turn in the morning and you can see the steam coming out of the compost because it got cooking and", "the middle was pretty hot and so you want to turn it so that it is even and eventually it has this beautiful soil that is very healthy and fertile", "and it is going to grow beautiful new life you can create a compost that is appropriate for the size of your property if you have a bigger space you might want to grow a nice big compost", "so that is why have lots of options if you have a smaller space you can grow a comp post or supplement with compost it is really your choice", "so that is why do not necessarily need a tractor you can have a shovel or a fork to turn it", "but we regularly turn it with the tractor we wait patiently for it to be ready to use now moving on to talking a little bit more about animal manure", "like i said we were borrowing cow poop from our neighbor", "we were literally going over there with the tractor and adding some cow manure to our compost", "but we want to be a little bit more biodynamic", "have our own farm animals so our neighbor actually was getting rid of this fencing and did not want it anymore", "he has horses and actually does not want to have goats", "so we thought it would be great to start with some goats we can utilize their manure we of course love the company of our farm babies", "but it is really awesome that goat manure is actually rich in nitrogen phosphorus and", "potassium manure returns organic matter and other nutrients like calcium magnesium and sulfur to soil which helps build soil fertility and quality so that is why actually wanted to get goats first and foremost to help us build our compost", "and we would love to get more animals down the line", "but of course you have to build the proper enclosure and there is a process that goes into adding any new animal", "and i will share some of the resources that i have been reading and studying before we take on any of these new additions", "but it is", "it is a process", "so that is why have been living here for about three years", "and we have been talking about adding animals but uh taking the time to study and and figure out how we want to approach it", "so today we took the fencing", "and we were", "just basically it took us an entire day to put it up and get it set up", "i ca not help but take my shears and pick weeds because the weeds drive me crazy", "so i manually walk through the yard whenever i am in the area and try to pick as many as possible which also gets thrown in the compost or now can be given to our new goats that are coming so", "we wanted to get the enclosure up and running we usually upgrade all of our enclosures", "so that is why will eventually have an indoor outdoor barn situation", "and then we also would like to have you pasture areas down the line things like that we have goals", "but we do take it one step at a time one man is trash", "is", "another man is treasure", "our neighbor basically said he was gonna throw all of this away", "and we are like we could definitely make use of all of this", "so i picked it all up from his property", "took it out", "and um i am gonna upcycle a lot of it", "and you will see one of the items i am going to use", "i mentioned", "i think it was in my last video in our front yard", "we are planting a lot of roses we are going to be planting climbing roses and i am going to use this for a water feature", "and i will share that diy down the line", "but as soon as i saw that i said do you want this", "and he was going to throw it away", "and i was like", "heck", "no you are not throwing that away i am going to turn that into a water feature", "so anyway i pulled all that out of the truck and", "then little by little we spent the day getting the gate up and also we had a little roof that we had to put up as well", "so it was a crazy day in the heat", "but it was well worth it when we were finished which we are not entirely finished we are still working on the indoor outdoor portion", "but we got it finished enough to house the goats and to bring them home", "okay", "brian and", "i have been together for 16 years and we definitely have our fair share of disagreements", "but i think we have gotten to a point in our relationship where we are very clear about our vision and what we want for our family and for our life and so that is why try to work well together", "be efficient and try to do a good job without arguing over minutia", "i would say with projects like this once we learned to do that with each other we became much more efficient actually one of my followers had been offering me goats", "she wanted to re home", "some of her goats", "and she said that she felt like she trusted me to take them", "which i felt honored that she did", "and so i took the mama and her babies", "so this was their first morning home", "and i woke up early for my normal early rise routine", "and now i feed the dogs first then", "the cat then the chickens and then the goats and", "today i actually added some straw i was using straw in my chicken coop", "so i actually had some left over", "i am gonna put a little bit of ground cover so that it is a little softer for them", "it also hides some of their manure which i will clean up regularly and add to the compost this is going to be an indoor outdoor barn eventually", "but right now this is the enclosure that we have for now for them and", "then even today as i am doing this voiceover", "we are adding you can do a ton of research", "but also i think a lot of what we have done is just trial and error fixing things as we go adjusting to our animals and the situation on our particular environment", "so that is why are always adding to try to make things better that is why we call our coop like coop 2 0 coop 6 0", "and i think it is going to be the same way with the goats we want to learn as we go", "be you know continue to do better and learn from you know our situation", "and if you go into it like that you wo not you wo not feel so intimidated by it", "and we we try not to be we try to be open minded and learn", "and we have got a lot of great advice from other people as well", "and so that is why are kind of taking it one step at a time we are definitely obviously not professional at this", "this is all just what we enjoy doing", "and i mean i never used to be an early riser i used", "to be i used to try to sleep in as much as i could but", "obviously after having kids i started waking up early and then now that i have all the animals they all give me so much joy to wake up to them in the morning", "and they are all so happy and excited to get their food", "and it is a joy for me to see them and and spend that time with them in the morning and to care for them", "it just makes me feel so happy and purposeful", "and i just love it so after i added some straw to their little enclosure i am now moving over to the big garden i have some work i have to do in there today", "i am gonna be pulling from the garden", "actually we had some gopher is munch on root", "and so i had to pull everything and harvest the white pumpkins", "early we have pumpkins a little early this year", "we still have some more in the big garden so hopefully the gophers do not get to those but the entire plant was dying so i decided to harvest everything", "and i had a nice big wheel barrel of white pumpkins", "there was a few other things that i had to harvest pick and pull so that i had space to plant our fall garden", "i was all up in this", "and it did have some kind of pricklies", "so i ended up putting on flannel to avoid my arms getting destroyed", "but i was stoked to have all of the white pumpkins even if they are a little early", "so i am a little behind on planting my august seeds i have a lot that i want to plant", "i have got some collard greens i have got", "carrots broccoli cauliflower chives some more like swiss chard", "i have got so many different things that i am gonna plant and in terms of resources i wanted to share quickly uh in addition to watching and following other farmers that i find interesting", "and i like their practices um and pinterest and youtube and all that there are several different books that i have read and also audiobooks that i have listened to and lectures and all sorts of information that i am trying to absorb about you know growing food raising animals", "and there is a lot of different information", "there is a lot of different opinions and ways to do things", "um but these are a few different books that i have been reading and and kind of following do", "now we plant our seeds we cover with compost and then mulch and we wait and see if we have a wonderful fall harvest which i will definitely share so that completes this video kind of wanted to share with you what we have been up to", "and i try to post daily on instagram", "so if you want to keep up with us every day you can find us on our personal accounts rachel talbot and byron talbot and also we have an account for our farm pacific time a time spelled like the herb where we share what we are growing and more info on all of that", "so hopefully you enjoyed this video and we will see you very soon in the next video bye you"], "KjGK7VeWN_M": ["today is video is going to be an outdoor chores video", "and i have started and", "i am going to continue to share them", "seasonally we have our routine in the morning", "and then in the evening and then of course every day looks a little different depending on what new projects we have going on today we were prepping for new projects propagating and also harvesting an abundance of herbs for our chicken coop when i first started experimenting with waking up early i tried a few days in the week", "and then i slowly added up to pretty much doing it every single day i wake up anywhere between 4 30 and 6", "i definitely reached for coffee when i first started but my body is getting more used to that daily schedule and so now i drink a cup of green tea", "and i recently made this little area for my cat in the garage blue was born feral", "and he was all by himself found in the city inside of a tire our intention was for him to be a farm kitten", "and he is just doing a fantastic job since we spend so many hours outside", "he is a fantastic garden companion and he is currently in training to help us out with some critters what so after i greet feed and give my animals fresh water which is definitely part of my daily routine the first thing i do", "when i wake up i now head over to the rose garden although this is a new addition my husband added the dripline irrigation so that has helped out a lot as i was previously watering them all by hand", "but i like to go and check", "and if i can do any pruning with roses for me i prune when they bloom i love to get blooms and put them in my home", "but also i like to clip anything that is dying and that is great for the compost or it works as potpourri", "as well you can add some essential oil and here i am adding some cardamom it makes a great potpourri", "i do daily updates from the garden on my instagram stories and lately i have been covering compost which i will do a video on here", "this is my compost bucket for scraps", "i also pruned some of the stems for some propagation we are experimenting more with propagation we have had some success in the past", "and we have not done it yet with roses", "so my husband byron actually explained this to me and", "i am going to do my best to try to explain it to you", "so wherever he plans to dip in the soil he is going to expose the cambium layer of the plant", "the cambium cell layer is essentially the growing part of the plant honey is a natural root hormone it is anti fungal antibacterial", "but you can also find root hormone at nurseries and stores that sell garden supplies we have recycled these containers from the past when we have bought seedlings from the store", "and of course when we got started when we were experimenting we were going to local stores", "sometimes we still do", "but i think our desire is to start working with what we have and building off of that which is why propagation is so great", "it is a basically a way to recycle what you already have growing", "it is a 50 50 shot you know", "a lot of times propagation does not work", "but we are going to see how these go we are going to water and cover", "and then we will keep you posted on how that goes we also did the same thing with our pomegranate trees after checking in on the rose garden and starting our propagation project", "i moved on to the herb garden which i wanted to do a significant amount of pruning and trimming because i have a lot of herbs especially mint peppermint things like that", "i have become much more consistent with my pruning and the growth of my plants", "has improved because of it", "i have an abundance of all of this byron", "actually built me this drying table for right next to my herb garden", "so i can sift and dry", "so today i am drying herbs for the chicken coop", "i now want to move over to the chicken coop", "i have a lot of work to do over here", "i have some weeding some raking and some prepping", "i have a goal to plant a garden specifically for my chickens around the chicken coop there are some herbs that are healthy for chickens that are great for them", "and so i might propagate or save the seeds and try to grow what i am growing in my herb garden around my chicken coop some of them the ones that they can enjoy and that are healthy for them", "so today i am focusing on raking up excess leaf foliage around the coop", "i am gonna throw that into the compost to get it nice and organized and clean in preparation for planning for the garden chickens can get scraps from the garden they love a variety of herbs seeds we have plenty to share so that we can diversify their diet", "and they are not getting feed from the feed store now after i did some prepping over at the chicken coop", "i came back to the front yard to help out byron he was finishing off taking mulch from the truck and putting it onto the rosebed", "and then we are continuing to clean up in this area i am actually taking large rocks from over in front of our fence", "we have a big project that we want to do in front of our fence with climbing roses", "but it is going to take a few stages because we have to prep that entire area in front of the fence with new soil", "so that is why are waiting for our compost to be finished to do that i needed to help by starting to move the big rocks over to where the rose garden is", "i also weeded a little bit over there just starting to clear off", "we are going to have to take the tractor for all of the smaller rocks in the future not every job that we do i would consider relaxing by any means", "but we both have a very clear vision and long term goal and", "sometimes you have to do things like moving big rocks picking weeds that even though in the moment they do not seem like they are fun they have purpose and meaning because they contribute to the long term vision i try to suck it up and do it", "because i know i am going to love it", "when it is finished in the mornings i have green tea", "and then it slowly becomes iced tea throughout the day", "so i always have iced tea hanging around for both of us so that when we get thirsty we have something to enjoy and drink", "i also have a goal for a diy water feature which will be down the line", "but i am prepping the area underneath the tree just raking up any additional leaf foliage this summer", "especially i have been finding myself slipping on really inexpensive lightweight dresses like this", "is one from kohl",

dust kicked up into my face like cleaning out the chicken coop or sweeping", "so i like to have a bandana wrapped around my neck so that i always have it to lift up above my nose if i need to protect my lungs", "i have a big hat", "i actually got this one from the grocery store to protect my face from the sun a good pair of gloves", "i hate looking everywhere for my gloves", "so i try to keep them on me after wasting some time looking for shears and gloves", "i finally ordered an outdoor garden apron which has been working great", "it is lightweight but a great place to store gloves and shears i come in and out of the house all throughout the day but during the hot portion of the day i come in and make meals for the kids", "do some indoor chores work on some projects inside", "and then we come back out as a family again once it starts to cool down and pick up on some chores so some of the herbs were dried and ready to go if i am doing teas or herbs that i want to use inside", "i will usually dry them inside but outdoor herbs for the chickens i can just put on this new table i have now", "and it is perfect for drying an abundance of herbs", "my niece and nephew come over here a lot", "so the kids were playing", "i can get some chores done", "and then i called them in for dinner we had dinner", "and then we were back outside pretty much until the sun sets just so that we can enjoy the summer nights working and the kids having fun playing last night", "i cleaned out the chicken coop", "and i take all the leftovers that are kind of dirty and gross from the chicken coop", "and i throw that in the compost then once it is clean i can put fresh straw inside the roost", "and then i can scatter some of the mixed herbs", "the dried citronella is helpful for the flies and bugs inside of the roost and also the mint and the spearmint it is gonna make the coop smell so much better", "and it actually has therapeutic elements for the chickens so not can they consume it", "but they also enjoy it in their living space as well", "so it is like a little spa for the chickens if i have it why not use it to take better care of my environment and my animals", "so that completes my summer outdoor chores be sure to subscribe to my channel on instagram", "i try to share daily updates on what we are doing on any given day", "so that is why can come over there and say

thought I would take you on a walk through our gardens", "I set my alarm for five o clock this morning", "I do my morning routine which I recently shared in my early rise morning routine video", "and then I do my rounds in the garden to check on everything", "and", "so I thought I would share with you what we have now and what is to come in the next few months", "but first I got to get some coffee feed the animals", "and it is still kind of coming out of the dark and the Sun is rising and it will be really beautiful in the garden after I do a little bit of my morning routine", "and then I can take you guys through the gardens and show you what we are growing", "right now I am gonna take you first to the rose garden which is ever expanding because we started with a small patch of roses right in front of our gate", "and then we recently planted these you can go back a few videos ago where I showed the process of us planting this", "and I did mention in that video that we like to start with small patches", "see how that works", "and then we usually grow more of whatever is successful so this area of the front yard is where my son likes to play in the dirt with his tractors", "this is our original rosebush the first one we ever planted in front of our gate when you first enter our property and we have this beautiful vintage pink called amnesia rose", "and then we were given as a gift the deeper pink color", "but we plant mostly white with a few color pops here in there", "so that is why are continuing this part of the landscape", "and it is gonna it", "is gonna be like a path", "if you will that almost kind of looks like a river we are calling it the river of roses but we have mostly white and then a few colors here and there now here you will see we are moving the rocks out of the way to continue our lavender to have lavender all along the pathway going up to our front door", "we started first with a very small patch of lavender and now we have grown the patch even larger", "and we are going to continue to grow it larger and larger until eventually it will follow the path leading up to our entry doorway and", "this is our French lavender", "so I recently harvested most of the lavender so it is green right now with a few little buds here", "and there in some of my more recent videos I have been sharing how I use the lavender for around the

wood boxes", "I have shared before that we got them when we lived in our old home", "and we started our very first garden", "we got them at a citrus tree nursery and", "at the time I think they are about eighteen dollars", "and they were great for what we needed because we had a little area to garden they prevented critters from getting in there and kind of munching on what we were growing since they held up", "so well we decided to use them and keep them for our herb garden", "so we planted the jasmine and those and wrapped the Jasmine around the trellis my husband did that it was absolutely beautiful", "these white roses are holding up nice right behind my music studio moving past the herb garden and around the kids", "treehouse we have lots of beautiful vines and flowers growing on the

shared it in previous videos", "we let it go to flower", "and then now it is gone to seed", "so what I am doing here is I am collecting the tops here of the flowers that are drying and these are seeds

lots of celery seeds", "so that is why can plant more celery", "see some of them like dead ones drop", "and then they seed on the ground here", "we have some cilantro that is dried and gone to seed I

the garden and my mom had a cool garden growing up and her garden is even more epic now that we are grown and out of the house", "and she has time to garden", "but luckily my husband is a fantastic gardener and we really enjoy expanding our garden every single year so you will see a lot of my garden during these months because this is when it is really thriving and when we get a lot of goodness to enjoy today", "i am going to harvest some herbs that i want to use for self care", "so i have some peppermint some eucalyptus", "some lavender", "this is calendula", "this is actually the first year that i had a pretty decent harvest of calendula", "and i finally learned how to properly harvest it which is pulling off the tops there the flowers", "and then i d say every other day i get a new bloom of calendula flowers", "so i dry them in a bowl you can use them for tea", "you can use them for bath time you can use them for a balm", "it is incredibly healing to the skin my cat definitely likes to hang out with me when i am in the garden", "he is a good garden companion i am also picking a little bit of aloe", "how crazy is this aloe plant doing it started out small", "and it almost died for about three years in a row and", "finally it is just absolutely flourishing it barely needs to be watered as much as it used to", "so it is a wonderful plant to have every year and", "especially during the summer i will be honest", "i love sitting in the sun in my bikini in the summer months for about 20 minutes", "i use an spf for tanning oil and try to get an even tan versus kind of like a farmer is tan", "and then i also love to read a good book outside", "right now i am reading the woman in the window which i started in this book called hope rising which is a beautiful book about a ranch that rehabilitates horses and uses those horses to work with children", "there are some beautiful stories it is definitely a tear jerker and another favorite of mine in the summer is using what we are growing in the garden like i shared in my previous videos with teas and cooking today i am going to use some of what i am growing specifically for a summer spa day which i love to do so", "a few things that i picked from the garden are the vintage pink roses which smell nice", "i dried some eucalyptus from our eucalyptus tree", "i dried some lavender english and french", "i think english has", "a more noticeable lavender scent french lavender is a little bit more subtle but they are both nice", "i also have some calendula flowers that i dried", "so i usually pick them like i showed", "earlier put them in a bowl and let them dry for a few days i have some fresh lavender", "and then i also have some fresh rosemary i am also going to take out the inside of the aloe vera plant", "and i am going to blend that really really good", "so i have the gel the gel can be used for so many different things you can mix it with clay for an aloe vera clay face mask if you have acne prone skin", "i also like to add fresh aloe to body creams or body lotion", "the coconut body butter from trader joe is which is amazing", "i shared it in a previous video", "it is like five dollars at trader joe", "is has the most epic coconut smell i like to mix some fresh aloe vera with that and rub it all over my skin", "i do try to keep my skin hydrated and", "especially during these months when you are spending time out in the sun it is always a wise idea to stay really hydrated i also have these sheet masks", "they are basically they", "they are the masks without anything on them", "and then i am creating my own serum to dip into them with just aloe vera and water", "so it is the aloe vera gel and some water equal parts you can add a drop or two of lavender essential oil if you want", "and of course most of these herbs can be found at local stores that carry herbs so health food stores", "or you can get them online at mountainroseherbs com", "even if you do not have a garden you can still find dried herbs to use for different skincare treatments also you can find aloe vera gel pretty easily at most health food stores and i did use aloe vera gel before i ended up growing aloe vera myself", "summer hair can definitely feel dry", "i recently lightened my hair and i also spend time in the sun", "and so it is always nice to do a treatment and a very simple treatment of olive oil and fresh peppermint and rosemary", "makes a nice deep oil treatment both for the scalp and", "also the hair itself or you can use it as a serum so one thing i do like to do in the summer", "is to try not to blow dry my hair but let it dry naturally it is been pretty hot so a lot of times i will take a shower at night", "i will put my hair in braids after my shower", "and then i will wake up and pull my hair out of the braids", "and then i have these waves", "and then i like to add a drop or two of the olive oil mixture to my hair focusing on my ends", "and if i want an even deeper treatment i will put all of the oil and saturate my hair with the oil and then leave it in for a few hours or overnight i do this after i have come in from being in the sun in the past", "i have also used coconut oil which works great for my hair", "but i recently switched to olive oil which i like as well", "so there is a lot of different options for hair oils", "and then now i am going to do a cooling summer herbal bath", "i am first pulling out my kids toys because they take baths in here too", "and they definitely enjoy this big bathtub", "they are actually in my bath more than me definitely in the summer months because i do not take as many baths", "when it is hot outside which is why today i am going to be doing a cooling bath", "so i always use the base of epsom salt you can add essential oils to epsom salts such as chamomile lavender rosemary", "but i am adding fresh herbs calendula leaves eucalyptus and lavender rose and eucalyptus and then lavender by itself", "and then i will have bath salts that will last me through the summer and into september and october when i will make bath salts that are more appropriate for the next season", "so i love these combinations for the summer", "and then i usually draw a bath that is kind of lukewarm to be honest and that might not seem enjoyable", "but it is not so cold that i do not want to get in not too hot not too cold", "and then when i get out it is usually pretty warm because it is a hot summer day", "and so i feel actually refreshed", "it smells amazing", "it is refreshing and also calendula is incredibly healing to the skin so this might seem a little weird but instead of letting this go down my drain which i would not want to do i am going to collect the leftovers", "and i can either throw it in my compost if i have used something that i do not want to feed to my chickens or to be honest my chickens", "would absolutely love this there are so many herbs in the garden that they love and that are great for them and the calendula makes their egg yolks really dark orange", "so my version of summer me time or what feels like a vacation at home is spending some time in the sun coming in doing some skincare treatments", "maybe a cooling herbal bath put some eye cream on get out of my bathing suit", "and then if i can i try once a week to ride with my neighbor on her horse pancho", "i worked with him during the spring", "and we try to ride at least once a week if not a few times if we can so her", "and i like to ride together and", "our husbands like to exchange what they are growing in the garden so byron brought over a sack of potatoes and we took some of their tomatoes and then also the boys love to come say hi to the horses and the dogs", "so it is pretty hot in the day to do a trail ride", "but we have nice trails right off of our properties", "so we try to take advantage of that and just enjoy a sunset ride when we can", "and we can keep our six feet distance", "so it is been the perfect thing to do during this quarantined summer", "it is been great since she has a lot of horses i helped her out with poncho who she tried to retire about a year ago", "but he needed to be rehabilitated so that is why came and ate a lot on my property", "i did some ground work with him and rode him a lot in the spring", "and then we tried to keep him in shape in the summer

months and I personally prefer my iced tea unsweetened", "but I like infused flavors", "the China mist has a passionfruit and a watermelon you can make big batches of it for guests or a get together or for yourself for me", "I absolutely love to sip on it and", "there is actually a restaurant we go to called Lucille", "is and they serve a watermelon iced tea in a mason jar and they also have iced watermelon cubes inside the mason jar", "so that is why noticed that when I ate there I go there sometimes just to get their tea to go", "so that is why thought I would start making it at home", "we also love watermelon in the summer", "my kids are big fans of watermelon", "so that is why picked up a watermelon", "I accidentally got this yellow one which in my opinion is a little bit more mild than a traditional red watermelon but as tasty and works for what I am gonna do with the iced tea", "my husband is actually gonna chop this up into cubes and then everything else is gonna be for the kids", "but I am gonna freeze a few of these cubes for", "the ice tea Byron actually does have a few videos on his channel about how to chop fruit which might seem common knowledge but it can be tricky sometimes to chop certain types of fruit so that is why learned how to chop fruit from him", "but if he is around I usually ask him to do it since he is much more precise and less likely to injure himself now for this recipe obviously the watermelon does not have to be perfect cubes but the point is that you want to have frozen watermelon cubes", "and then you can add them with ice and have a yummy infused ice tea for the summer", "one of the benefits of an herbal garden is many of the herbs that you do grow can also be used for tea and different tea blends", "if you are a fan of

can be tricky to get it started and to have it flourish so be patient with it", "but this was a clip from a previous video where I made a lavender soap", "so I harvested the lavender I clipped it",

and dry and use for next year", "and then I can also take the rest and use it for tea", "I could put it in sachets for throwing in the dryer or under a pillow you can use it for lavender creme brulee or a lavender iced tea lavender", "is a very calming and therapeutic herb so great for so many different uses and wonderful as a tea you can also blend it with an herb like chamomile which I really love", "as well chamomile can be used on its own or blended with lavender there are two ways that I personally like to harvest my chamomile", "so because chamomile is just dried chamomile flower you can twist and pull off the actual flower itself and just let those dry or", "I sometimes cut it at the stem and hang it upside down lemon balm", "is another one that I like to grow it is great for calming so relaxing tea blends but also for the occasional upset stomach or nausea catnip is good again for calming so", "I collect bundles", "and then I hang them up on my herb drying rack outside that usually takes about two to three days you can use a mortar and pestle if you are doing a fine seasoning which I like to do for my thyme and oregano but for peppermint lemon balm chamomile I can use my fingers to break up the leaves or pull the chamomile flowers off the stems", "and then I can store these in mason jars depending on how much I harvest", "I will have small or larger mason jars

left over from yesterday and get the kitchen cleaned up before the day officially started when my two boys woke up", "so that is my early rise morning routine which I love in terms of", "I know I use

around the house what we are doing project wise", "and I thought I would share with you an update on our property I captured this footage over the last few days in between doing my chores inside like the kitchen cleanup and the laundry and all that that I have also been sharing we have a lot of projects going on in our gardens we had to update our chicken coop and also we were working on some landscaping so for today", "is video", "I thought I would give you a little peek at what we have been up to starting first with the chicken coop we are currently updating our chicken coop", "this is probably 6 0 at this point", "we started the chicken coop", "the very first one we built together was in the very far back there that little house which is actually their roost recently we lost a flock of chickens to a predator and it was discouraging and depressing", "but we knew we had to do an even better job of securing the coop and making it more structurally sound so Biron completely rebuilt the structure around the roost we wanted it to match the fencing for our large garden to the right there", "we are working on realigning the structure with metal fencing we did have metal fencing before", "but we are trying a double layer this time", "so that is why also have metal fence mesh", "and then it also comes down over the dirt", "and we are gonna put the dirt on top of that to hopefully prevent from anything digging underneath the roots there are times when predators are more prevalent and you d be surprised at what great lengths they will go to to actually get to the chickens so rebuilding it and hoping that it is structurally sound so that this does not happen again in the future but it is something we prepared ourselves for as everyone that we know that has chickens and from all of our research it is", "it is rather common to lose a flock every once in a while during certain seasons especially to a predator so we are hoping that we have better luck this time", "we love our chickens", "so we have some new chickens that are in a coop in the barn", "it is a movable coop", "so we move them around the day so that they can graze as of now", "and then we put them in the barn at night and", "until this coop is finished we will keep them safe there", "and I think at this point actually by time I am doing this voice over the coop is pretty much finished cleaning up a few spaces here and there to it is as secure as possible", "so that is why did this to the sides and then now we are doing it on top", "and we you know it is all hands on deck when we have projects like this because as a family we enjoy these things and so that is why make the decision to work to maintain them shine on and then moving on to the front yard", "this is also a project that we have been working on when we first moved into this house", "three years ago it was pretty bare and minimal on our property", "we live just under three acres", "we had a vision", "but of course I had had a baby we had a new house and doing our business and everything all at", "once we knew it was going to take time to develop the things that we wanted to do so we made a five year plan and we budget and do projects little by little whether it is our gardens or landscaping", "it is a lot of learning and trial and error but one thing that has been very helpful is our tractor which we got when we first moved in", "and we knew we wanted to use it for countless projects now", "and you know in the future of owning our home for sure before we got the tractor we actually tried one of the projects moving the rocks manually", "and it was just it", "the whole family came over and we had several days of moving rocks back where our herb garden is", "my youngest son Isaiah is absolutely obsessed with the tractor he is always watching dad", "both my kids have become very responsible around the tractor and pay attention to all the projects that we are doing and Isaiah in particular likes to sit on Byron", "is lap and ride the tractor and he is a pretty good driver too", "so that is why are using this to move the rocks also grade and Byron", "is gonna amend the soil so that is why is also going to bring compost over from our big compost pile in the back of our property and bring that over here and amend the soil the way that we like to test things out is starting with a small patch of something and seeing how it does we have done that with lavender and with roses and with our garden and so Byron kind of understands the proper soil amendment and also the irrigation setup that is going to work", "and then once we figure that out then we plant more biron shares a little bit about his garden on his Instagram and on his YouTube channel but it is mostly cooking I am hoping he starts to share segments on hygge culture and the method he uses for gardening", "it is interesting on this day we also had a visit from the grandparents my parents had to come over", "I was gonna help my dad film a little video that he needed for work", "how cool is that", "okay", "so my dad is a musician and", "he is in Ringo Starr is all star band and they are not touring right now because of the coronavirus but every year on Ringo is birthday", "he does like a peace and love ceremony", "and they are doing a digital one this year", "and my dad had to film a little harmonica and sang happy birthday", "and he struggles a little bit with technology which I totally understand because I do too", "so that is why told him I would help him out today and the dogs were playing and having a grand old time we sat and watched the horses and jumped on the trampoline and had a little family time together", "and then we got right back to working on some projects", "this past Father is Day my brother who is a documentary filmmaker did a short documentary on my dad in his life and the different artists he is toured with and his history as a musician", "anyway I am gonna link it below", "I thought it was really sweet and Oliver is being a sweet little helper to byron while he finishes up building the coop so after my parents left they spent a little time here", "and then we decided later in the day to work on some projects around the barn", "so that is why have a goal for the barn as well", "but we are kind of taking it one step at a time here", "and today I had mentioned in the past how I would love to have grapevines kind of creeping along the barn", "and I showed Byron kind of my idea so that is why surprised me with grapevines and these barrels here", "and he is filling it up with amended soil and then planting the grapevines and hopefully those grow and thrive and do well and make the outside of the barn really pretty", "and he is gonna also add you will see in a second here", "he adds worm castings which is warm Pope", "it is basically like gold for the garden and we have a bin of worms actually worms and worm castings are amazing for the garden and kind of a secret weapon when it comes to soil and amending our soil", "so that is why am hoping he will talk more about this on his channel", "but but he is gonna water", "and then we are pretty much finished up with that we wanted to we got started with the Roses and planting the roses out front", "and we also wanted to make sure we got a good head start on the coop and that it is pretty much almost finished", "and then when he surprised me with these we decided to plant these in front of the barn as well so", "that was kind of a look at our day or the last two days rather and", "then in terms of our garden I am gonna do a full garden tour because we have three different gardens", "we have an herb garden we have our test garden which like I said earlier in the video we like to test out things and see how they do if they do okay", "then we usually do more of whatever as thriving and doing well so this large garden is things that we have tested in our smaller garden like", "potatoes garlic artichokes things that are doing really well", "and then we plant them in the large garden so that is why can plant a lot of them", "we also have watermelon pumpkins and squash which will be ready in a few weeks from now so that finishes up everything that we were doing for the last two days pretty much", "I went in and out of kind of filming what I was up to inside the house and what barn was up to outside and just thought I would share with you kind of like a real life vlog of our day if you will anyway", "I hope this video was interesting to you", "if you like my

us", "so we actually have our niece and nephew come and stay in this guest room", "but also my husband is family moved back to Albuquerque New Mexico and they come to visit as well", "so that is why

have this space for them in the summer months", "I do focus on the windows a little bit more just because I noticed that people open the windows more in the summer months especially in the morning

flies end up in my windows kind of gross", "so that is why am vacuuming everything up getting it nice and clean", "and then I am cleaning up the windows screens and the glass on the windows as well

the past I have actually rented them from Lowe", "is", "but you can no longer do that with the coronavirus and so that is why thought you know what we should probably invest in one", "and honestly it was an amazing investment so that is why am gonna of course vacuum and", "then steam clean the carpet between my animals and also the kids and my niece and nephew they like to have like sleepovers in that room", "and there is a little spillage here", "and there it is just an amazing thing to have the steam cleaner", "I highly recommend it", "someone recommended it to me on my channel after I have been renting it", "and it is so much better to have your own and this one works amazing", "and then I am also another basic that I try to do is convert my kids bathroom into a guest bathroom", "so there is no toothpaste on the walls and there is no like pee on the side of the toilet", "I definitely try to there is fresh towels things like that fresh toiletries", "cotton swabs a fresh candle and maybe some flowers from the garden", "and we are good to go with the guest living space", "I absolutely love flowers and if I was not growing them I would buy them from the store", "but I love growing them because I can step outside and pick a few and put a few flowers in the guest bedroom and also in the bathroom", "it is been a huge goal of mine to grow as many flowers as possible and herbs so that I can pick and use them in my home", "I used to be pretty intimidated by cooking especially for family and friends and I would usually kind of leave it up to my husband since he was a professional chef as of lately", "I have been really inspired to start stepping out and cooking more and being more creative I am very inspired by how my husband cooks I love when he cooks for me I have been watching him for years", "I have learned so much I love the Barefoot Contessa", "I love the Pioneer Woman", "there is so many great recipe ideas between YouTube and the Food Network", "there are so many different options for recipe ideas and just find someone that resonates with you and your style of cooking if cooking intimidates you like it used to intimidate me keep it simple", "a meal plan does not have to be over the top if you enjoy cooking and you love hosting there is so many great recipe ideas for that as well", "so that is why am making a meal plan", "I am gonna keep a few of the meals simple taco night", "I recently shared on my tik tok", "but I will share it", "one day here it is like my favorite pasta recipe to make for the kids", "it is easy it is sprucing up a jar of store bought marinara with some herbs and garlic and a few other things so something simple", "and then I am gonna do a yummy seafood dish from the Barefoot Contessa", "I am gonna put that recipe below if you like seafood you might like it once", "I make a meal plan I do inventory with what I already have then make a grocery list head to the grocery store get what I need for the meals maybe some extra snacks or hors d oeuvres and then some beverages when it comes to beverages I try to stick with whatever I know", "they like", "so if I know they like wine I will usually have that for the dinners but in general throughout the day most people really like ice tea", "and I love", "this passion fruit iced tea from China mist iced water is of course always a great option and you can put it in a little craft next to their bed sparkling water", "is another one that a lot of people like for kids I usually like to mix um type of juice with some plain sparkling water there is a country peach juice that is good from Trader Joe", "is", "so the kids usually like that back when my husband was a cook at Bouchon", "it was a really fancy restaurant and for us in that especially that time of our marriage", "I think I noticed and tried to pay attention to the style of hospitality the detail that they would put into the meal I would pay attention and take note", "and I thought you know down the line", "I am gonna try that I am gonna serve iced tea in a carafe like that", "is a nice little twist", "so little things like that that I will notice when I watch someone else cook or when I go to a restaurant something that makes the experience extra special hospitality is something that my husband and I talk about a lot different recipes and different ways to serve guests and it is something we d like to take outside of our home one day and maybe offer via a restaurant or something something that we talk and dream about", "but right now we share with family and friends and maybe down the line when our kids are older we will see but like I said I used to be very intimidated by this whole process now I am learning how to enjoy myself and especially right now like we have been growing this garlic and one little small thing I love about cooking nowadays", "is", "when my fingers smell like garlic at the end of the day I do not know it reminds me of the smell of home", "and it it is nice to have something yummy on the stove makes a house smell the way it is supposed to this", "is a recipe I knew that my husband would love", "and it is like a nice fancier dinner maybe like a date night dinner type of thing or when you have guests over and you want to have something fancy", "I decided to make this as well because we are growing a lot of the ingredients like the fennel and the potatoes and the garlic there", "we harvested and stored several pounds of potatoes so that is why have plenty of garlic potatoes and fennel", "and then I am also adding some white wine so this recipe seemed like something everybody would like", "and I can also utilize some of the ingredients that I already have", "I always have a can of tomatoes or tomato paste in my cabinet", "it is one of those things I always have", "I got some French bread with a little olive oil and salt and pepper", "I am gonna toast that up for like little kind of croutons on the side", "and it did really feel like something we would have eaten at Bouchon for sure", "this felt really like a special recipe and so although I do not cook like this every night for sure", "I went and got some fresh seafood from Whole Foods and used a lot of our garden ingredients I will share this recipe below if you are a seafood lover", "it is ina Gardens recipe and not mine", "but it turned out great", "and I would recommend putting together some type of meal plan", "cook whatever your if you want to experiment with cooking maybe find a fun recipe that is a little bit more challenging or a little bit different or a little special and then keep the rest of the meals simple but making sure you have all the ingredients you need to be prepared ultimately", "I do think it is important to be authentic in your style of hospitality", "so what feels real and natural for you will resonate with your guests", "the main takeaway is that it is really great to spend that time with family and friends and", "you know sometimes friends are your family and having them with you and being a hospitable and welcoming people into your home and offering them a nice cold beverage a warm clean place to sleep you know in one season of your life", "it might be in a tiny little apartment where you know our family slept on the couch and on a blow up mattress and then another phase of our life here", "we are that we get to

house is full of laughing and playing and good food and wine and it is so much fun", "but then more dishes are made and things kind of get messy", "so that is why know I am coming back in after a week

kind of doing my normal declutter", "so today my husband was actually working outside on the tractor", "there was like a broken piece on the tractor", "and then I think he was dealing with some

deeper cleaning like clean out the trash cans and underneath where the trash cans live when we are cooking a lot it can kind of start to smell underneath there and get kind of gross", "so that is why like to go back there and clean that out along with the inside of the trash cans sometimes keeping cleaning simple", "is the way to go and a lemon if something I use a lot first of all who does not love the smell of a lemon it smells amazing and if you put a little bit in like your trash can bins you can even put a little tiny bit of vinegar and then wipe that down the inside it makes a huge difference in how that area smells and when you are putting trash away a lot sometimes you missed the basket or a little fudge and sometimes the kitchen just gets that trash smell so going in and cleaning out the trash bags underneath", "where the trash is", "you know it is different for every home but", "ours is kind of a cabinet here", "so it is easy for odor to get locked in that general area", "so that is why am putting fresh trash bags in", "I do not do this every day obviously", "but I can kind of tell when I need to do it", "I like to use lemon for other areas of the kitchen as well", "sometimes I do not want to use a sponge or I run out of a sponge", "and I do not want to run to the store on that day", "so a lemon wedge and some salt works great for cleaning the stove it smells good", "it leaves a shine and it is easy and inexpensive", "the salt and lemon trick is great for mild to medium messes once things get a little worse I usually use a very abrasive sponge", "I

it and have so much of it", "but today I have the rosemary", "the lavender some mint and some lemon which is the star of this video", "and I am gonna do a pot pourri I love to do potpourri in the fall", "I simmer a combination of apples", "oranges cloves and cinnamon and it makes the whole house smell spicy and lovely and in the summer the combination that you can use is more herbal more fresh and uplifting so if you do not have lavender you can certainly use lavender essential oil", "I grow a little bit of English lavender in my herb garden", "and then I have some French lavender in my front yard they do smell a little different", "and I like having both to use around the house and for different ingredients so starting with my English lavender", "I have a simmering pot of water",

essential oil rosemary and lemon or even lemon essential oil and rosemary you can change it up and do a different combo but the three smell nice", "and I let that come to a boil and then down to a simmer", "I usually have that for about 15 20 minutes going in my kitchen so that it gets rid of any yucky smell and just makes the overall room smell really good", "so something I have been needing

ones", "but I thought I would clean the inside of the dishwasher", "I do have some lemon in salt", "I am gonna start with that", "and then also I also put some vinegar in with that", "so I am trying to get it as clean as possible", "and then I am gonna run a cycle I have a stainless steel cleaner that I sometimes use", "but I it is hard to find a good one", "so that is why am actually gonna use a little vinegar with a cleaning rag right now to get some of the fingerprints off of the dishwasher I am gonna do the same thing to my refrigerator my microwave and my ovens", "and then I am gonna clean out the inside of my refrigerator which I try to do this every time before I go grocery shopping once the refrigerator is cleaned out I can take inventory of what we have and then go get

gonna let that cool down until it is just starting to begin to harden", "and then I am gonna put that in my KitchenAid mixer same deal as when I make a whipped cream for a pie I am basically doing the same thing but with body butters and this works great for an overall body butter as well or a shave cream so you can kind of do either or", "I also add some essential oils to make it in herbal blend in this case I am using rose essential oil", "but you could use any one of your choice I am going to whip this for a few minutes until it starts to turn into a very whipped texture", "and then I am going to put that into a container if you cover this", "you can save this in a cool dry place or stick it in the refrigerator", "it will harden a little bit more", "but you can still use it as a shave cream also when you wash it off your legs", "are left smooth", "I d say the downside to this to be honest is that it can dull out a razor just because it is like putting on lotion in the shower", "but

cup of tea and let that cool down completely before putting it into a jar", "I also like to keep this in the refrigerator during the summer months a lot of people like to finish their shower with a cool shot to help seal the cuticle and make your hair shiny", "you can actually replace that with this and make this your final step you do not need to rinse use this as a final rinse the combination

this bleach combination", "and I know this is not for everyone", "and I think I have shared it before on my channel", "but I usually bleach my mustache and in between my eyebrows", "the reason I like

I am putting on some deodorant I am going back and forth right now between native and Pacifica which I both", "like", "but this one is coconut vanilla scent", "and then I recently got this Brazilian crush body spray", "it is not exactly what I expected it to smell like kind of reminds me of like a Victoria Secret body spray", "but it is not bad and the combination of that with the coconut body

little bit", "so I smell good throughout the day this", "I just got this foot bath in previous videos you have seen", "sometimes I use a big bowl and put some rocks at the bottom and do a pedicure so

little bit more so", "now I am gonna take off the mask and brush my hair when it is warm outside", "I usually just let my hair dry naturally", "and then I might add some waves with my wave crimper if

oatmeal soap then", "I also made some chamomile soap and some rosemary and lemon soap", "these are easy recipes and you can make these as gifts you can also make it for guest bathrooms or for yourself", "if you want to during this time of the year I spend a lot of time outside", "I love to see all of my herbs and plants growing", "and then I like to utilize them but", "even if you do not grow your own herbs you can find these pretty easy and buy them online dried lavender and chamomile are pretty easy to find", "so that is why am gonna start first with lavender oatmeal soap", "we have been growing lavender for a while", "now we have had some luck", "and then we have had some lavender that has died so that is why have experienced trial and error for sure which is definitely how we have learned to garden", "and we have experimented with both English and French lavender", "so today it is actually time for me to harvest my lavender", "and there is so many different ways to use it my husband", "it loves to cook and has a cooking channel here on YouTube", "and he often will cook with the lavender if he is making like a lavender creme brulee or lavender ice cream or something", "but I like to use it for beauty products and also for around the house", "so the lavender sachets or lavender soaps lavender scrubs there is so many different ways you can use lavender", "plus I love the smell it is also great to display with other flowers I like to put it in my kitchen", "so there is so many great reasons to grow lavender I pick some I am hanging it up upside down", "and I am gonna let it dry for several days", "so that is why kept it drying for about out of direct sunlight usually in a shady spot for about four days then once it is dry", "I am going to take the buds and break them up", "now you want to harvest right before they flower so you can research a little bit more on when to harvest lavender", "but I harvested it just at the right time where they were just starting to flower", "and then they are dry", "and I am removing these flower buds and kind of separating them into a little container", "once you harvest lavender and let it dry and break it up like this you can actually keep these buds in a bag for six months to a year as long as it is in a dry cool place so again", "so many great uses", "you could even do lavender tea", "there is a lot of different ways to use it so that is why will share some more recipes in the future", "but today I wanted to make some gifts and some soap for around the house", "so I actually got this oatmeal melt and pour soap base from Amazon", "there are a lot of different options when it comes to soap bases", "so that is why can read reviews and look for the kind of ingredients that you are looking for in your soap", "I wanted something pretty clean", "so that is why read reviews", "and this one had great reviews", "and it is an oatmeal soap base", "so I wanted to do a lavender oatmeal", "so I just sliced the melt and pour bar", "and I have a double boiler here or a makeshift double boiler", "and I am gonna melt that so once it melts I am going to turn off the heat and begin to let it cool down in the meantime I have the dried lavender and then", "I also have soap molds which I found on Amazon", "as well there is a lot of different ways you can go with the soap molds they have ones that have pretty designs", "but what I am doing is putting some dried lavender at the bottom of the molds and", "I am gonna pour the soap over it once my soap base melted", "I added several drops of lavender essential oil I d say about eight drops", "but", "I also did not go with specific measurements for this recipe so that is why added a little bit", "and then I smelled to see if it was strong or if I should maybe add a little bit more", "so that is why kind of went based on my senses", "and I do not stick to a particular recipe being honest here", "and I tried a few different options", "so with the dried lavender being at the bottom this is how the soap looked", "and then I tried a version where I poured the soap first with nothing at the bottom and then put the dried lavender on top", "now they are both cool for different reasons obviously with the lavender on top", "it is gonna be a little prettier", "but there is some fallout once they have had a chance to set you can see how they look once I remove them from the soap molds", "so both are pretty but as a gift", "I think it is nice to have the lavender on top and have a little fallout", "but this is pretty as well", "and it works as good in terms of the soap", "I feel bad I did not get this video up in time for Mother", "is Day", "but I actually did make this for my mom as a Mother", "is Day present", "so that is why put it inside a little coffee mug that I got for her", "so that is why took some cheesecloth", "and I wrapped the finished lavender soap in the cheesecloth", "I took some twine and also put a fresh sprig of lavender so a easy homemade gift but again something that you can also make for yourself for your friends or for anybody who you think would appreciate it next up", "I am gonna be making some chamomile oatmeal soap with chamomile growing in my yard now", "I have chamomile growing in my herb garden and it is more contained", "but", "I also have it all over the yard from last year", "it almost grows kind of like a weed it ends up everywhere", "and you get these really beautiful chamomile flowers", "and I we do not spray with chemicals anywhere around our house so if they are growing up next to the house I can pick those flowers up and let them dry and use them for all sorts of different things for teas for skin care products", "so the way that you can harvest lavender is by picking off the flowers themselves they open up usually once the Sun comes out in the day they open up", "and they are beautiful and they smell aromatic", "and so that is why am picking the flowers", "and then I let those dry for several days and you can make tea with that", "but today I am taking my oatmeal soap base", "and I am doing exactly what I did with the lavender soap with a double boiler", "I am gonna", "melt", "it then let it cool down once it is had a chance to cool down", "I am gonna add a little bit of chamomile essential oil so cool down when I say cool down not so that it is starting to create a film but just so that it is not so hot", "the melt you want to it is not super super hot but", "once it starts to create a film on top and it starts to harden up", "you definitely want to", "you add the essential oil before that", "and then I am putting the dried chamomile at the bottom like I did with the lavender", "and then I am pouring the soap over and", "this time around I did put the chamomile at the bottom but I am also adding some on top so that is why am doing a combination of what I did before with the lavender", "and this turned out pretty as well", "like I said I do not follow a specific recipe but in this case if you wanted to you can always add other essential oils that complement chamomile", "so that is why kept it chamomile", "but you could do chamomile lavender you could do chamomile Rose", "there is so many different ways to go with it", "and it is about being creative next", "I am making rosemary and lemon soap for my kitchen now", "if you do not grow rosemary I highly recommend it", "it is a super hardy herb it can be used for so many different recipes for cooking for infusions for around the house", "it smells great", "I have an olive oil soap base from the same company that I got my other soap base on Amazon", "this is clear", "I am gonna put this into the double boiler", "let it melt once it is melted again cool it down", "let it begin to start to cool down and turn down the heat", "and then I am gonna chop up my fresh rosemary I am gonna zest an entire lemon", "and then I am gonna add that to the melt once it is had time to cool down a little bit I am gonna pour that in the molds and let that harden and again this is perfect for right by the kitchen sink for washing and scrubbing my hands after I have been preparing meals and cooking", "and you can also clean cutting boards with it", "so it is a fantastic soap that I wanted to share with you as well", "the wonderful thing about growing anything is figuring out how you can use it in your home and enjoy it so with herbs there are so many different ways to use them and this is just one way to have fun with it", "but if you do not grow your own herbs you can also make these easy by just going to the store and picking up some rosemary or ordering some dried chamomile or lavender from online and the soap base so it is a pretty easy recipe that

arrangements that really works well for me and also in direct sunlight", "so both for my indoor and outdoor succulents", "I find that it is best if it is mostly shady with a little access to indirect

life to this area by adding a candle and some fake and real plants", "and it is a little bit of a cluster of plants which I really like here it is nice because this is a fake plant I am adding some

Lobby", "I think it is cool", "I love the design of it", "you can plug it in and turn it on you can get wax melts from this company", "but I actually used to carry these in my shop", "my shop is no

am going to put the lavender in the wax melt and then with a candle and", "the wax melting", "I have a few seed starters some rosemary that I picked from the garden", "and then my fake and real plants on the kitchen sink since I have a lot of space behind my kitchen sink I have always loved to have candles and plants and flowers over in that area so once I let the wax melt the whole kitchen is

flowers", "I will go to Trader Joe", "is and make bouquets", "but they do die after a short period of time so if you could find a nice fake bouquet and you also it does not get dusty when it comes to

there", "so that is why am gonna go ahead and clean that as well now while I am doing this my husband has been outside working on a ton of different projects we are actually trying to turn our Shack into a barn so that we can eventually get some more animals", "so there is a lot of different things he is been doing in the garden while I have been working inside", "so that is why might see my kids getting their shoes on and kind of going in and out", "and we had nice weather at this particular moment", "so that is why were spending some time outside", "so that is why are just trying to be as productive as possible and also keep our house clean and cozy", "and I feel like that makes a big difference in how we all feel it is always nice to have a cozy clean house", "so gonna finish cleaning off the island I am gonna put the chairs back where they belong and then at that point I am pretty much finished cleaning up the kitchen there was not too much over at our kitchen table that was already pretty clean", "so every day is a little bit different in terms of how I clean the house I go based on you know if I know I want to clean the whole house what I want to get done in that day", "and I knew I had to get laundry done", "so today I am pulling out of the dryer the kids closed there was a few of my clothes in there", "but it was mostly the kids clothes and then in the washer", "I had some towels and bedding that I am gonna pull from the washer and move to the dryer", "and then I am gonna fold that in a little bit", "so that is why take that into the guest bedroom", "and then I fold it once I get to that area of the house moving on to the living room pretty much", "just have to pick up toys and fluff the pillows", "and", "I also like to vacuum the couch", "like I said I do not prefer that my dogs are on the couch so if I see them sleeping on this couch in particular I do ask them to get down", "but I have a few other couches that I put sheets on", "and then I I wash the sheets", "and I let them sleep on the couches because I am a sucker for the dogs and then sometimes they do end up sleeping on this couch", "and I give it a vacuum", "they are not super super hairy dogs", "so even so that is why do not get a lot of hair on", "and I have been cleaning off their little paws when they come in because it has been raining so that is why clean off their paws when they come in the house", "and then I am good I sweep the floor I have not had rugs in the house for probably over a year combination of having puppies and just kids who drop things drinks and different things", "so that is why decided I did not want to have any rugs", "but I am getting to the point now where my dogs do not have accidents anymore and the kids do not have accidents anymore", "so my parents were actually cleaning out their Shack during this entire", "you know stay at home quarantine", "and my mom said well she showed me a few things that she found", "and this was one of the things I really wanted which was my grandmother", "is rug this is in Armenian rug", "and I am 50 percent Armenian for those of you who do not know", "and this was", "my grandma is rug", "and I always loved this rug", "I asked my mom about it a few months back", "and she said I do not even know where that rug is", "and then she ended up finding it cleaning out her Shack", "so that is why took it", "it is in great condition", "I am gonna vacuum it up on both sides", "and I am gonna go ahead and put it in this room", "I feel like it is the perfect rug for this space plus", "it holds such beautiful memories of my grandma", "and I do not know", "I feel like I do not know she is with me", "she", "you know I do not know", "she knows", "I think", "so grandma thank you for the rug I love it", "but I am gonna put it in the space", "and I ended up the perfect addition to the space to just give it a little bit of pop of color and added something to this space that I feel like it needed so", "so that is why added that", "and then I am just gonna fluff the pillows and", "that is pretty much it for this space", "this space does not get a whole lot of traffic like the kids playing here", "we watch movies every once in a while", "Byron plays games in there", "but", "so next I am moving into the kid is room which is always a mess", "so I am gonna start by organizing the toys and the books because the toys and the books get out of control and then the clothes as well", "is they throw their clothes on the floor", "and then I am gonna fix their bed more recently", "we actually did bunk beds so Isaiah moved out of his crib and they are doing the bunk bed thing which has actually been working out great and super fun so that is why am gonna vacuum the floors fix the bunk beds and that is kind of the extent that I go to for the kids room", "I am actually I am always rethinking this room", "but since we added the bunk bed I am gonna be changing up this room a little bit more decor wise in the next few months", "so that is why will keep you guys posted on that", "but for now the basics vacuuming cleaning the beds cleaning the sheets so now with the laundry", "I am gonna", "start folding", "it is always just a mess", "this is the guest bedroom and this is where I fold the clothes I feel like there is always a designated spot for people to fold masses amounts of clothes", "but yes I get so much laundry", "and I throw it all on this bed the dogs do not come in here at all", "so at least I know it is hair free", "and I just start folding", "and I put it in sections", "so I have a section for each of the boys for a Byron for myself", "and then I fold in sections and then start taking everything slowly but surely to each room", "and eventually I get all of the laundry done", "and then I am gonna move to the boys bathroom which gets gross again", "as well the floors definitely need to be swept up and cleaned and mopped and then the toilet for sure and kind of doing the basics in here", "I use the steam mop in the bathrooms", "only this is the shark steam mop now I have had this for several years", "so that is why do not think they have this same model", "but you can find it on Amazon", "it is great", "it is actually get so hot that it disinfects", "so I use it in the bathrooms", "but I use a traditional mop for my main floors which looks like wood", "but it is actually tile", "so it is tile that appears to be wood so it is easy to clean", "and then I am just going to clean with a sponge just there", "sink on any given day", "you know sometimes I will make that area look a little prettier if I am having guests but my boys you know take over the bathroom and it ends up being kind of a mess", "so that is why am gonna clean it lightly", "and then I am gonna move finally into our bed well actually not finally", "I have a few more spaces to clean", "but I am going to move into our bedroom", "I have to do a deep clean of my closet which I might do a full video on that", "so that is why kind of skipped over my closet", "and I am gonna add some new bedding to my bedroom", "but my bedroom gets pretty again another high traffic area the kids are in here a lot", "obviously we sleep in here", "and we are in here", "so this area gets pretty messy", "it is pretty cold right now at night", "so I am adding a new blanket", "but I am just gonna put it on top of our other quilt so that we have to this", "was from the Magnolia collection at Target from chip and Joanna Gaines and then the actual bed itself was from overstock", "I still have some work to do in this bedroom", "I need to put a picture above our bed and just I need to add more", "but I just honestly I have not had a chance to do it lately", "I have not gotten around to it", "so maybe I will do it during this whole stay at home quarantine but fixing up the bed cleaning up the the floors and also the nightstands and things like that sweeping", "I still have my Pilates machine in my bedroom which I might move now to the room that Isaiah used to be in now that he is sharing a room with his brother and then my bathroom which again the master bathroom does get a lot of foot traffic a lot of clothes", "so that is why have to pull and start some laundry which is my husband and my clothes so for all of the spaces it starts with just decluttering picking up any clothes sweeping the floors putting everything back where it belongs that alone makes the space look so much", "and then you can do deep cleaning kind of at your own discretion which is what I do when I am cleaning so that is why am actually going to after I sweep the floor I am gonna steam mop the floor in this bathroom", "and then that pretty much takes care of the majority", "I clean the sinks I will clean around the bathtub because it does get dusty", "I will clean the area that I you know where I do my makeup", "but when I am cleaning the whole house I am keeping it pretty surface", "but it is", "it is amazing that when you are trying to get a lot done because I feel like today was just a full day of cleaning", "but it still was relatively surface", "the house still looked and felt really clean when I was done even though I did not detail clean so that is why know surface cleaning dusting sweeping the floors decluttering alone makes a huge difference lighting candles", "and and so after I finish up the bathroom I am gonna move to my music studio which gets the least amount of foot traffic because it is pretty much me and my dogs that come in here", "the kids come in here too sometimes to play but most of the time this is in the back room behind my bedroom", "so it when we moved in it was like a loft and", "now it is my music studio", "so I again sweep the floors I put my guitars back up on the wall", "I dust and organized declutter is what I do in this space", "so there is not a whole lot that goes on here", "I have my music books that I am gonna just declutter", "put everything back where it belongs and that pretty much is the entire house now", "one more thing that I had to do today was one more thing that my parents found in their Shack", "was my my granddad", "I called him Pappy Pappy is saddled he is from Texas", "this is from my dad", "is side", "so the rug was from my mom", "is side and the saddles from my dad is side", "it is a beautiful western saddle", "they found it in their Shack", "and I am like I will 100 take that I have been caring for my neighbor", "is horse having my neighbor is horse over a lot if you follow me on Instagram", "you will see that", "but we d love to get a horse in the near future", "and so we are kind of building infrastructure and preparing for that", "but I definitely wanted to clean up this saddle some saddle soap and condition it", "and so that was one more thing that I had to do today and", "that kind of completed my cleaning and chores for the day so all of this ended up being a 15 minute video", "but it did take me pretty much the entire day several hours to finish cleaning the entire house", "and I did not you know even do deep cleaning just surface cleaning I wanted to keep it super real with you guys", "I stuck my camera on a tripod and basically took you along as I clean the entire house", "and if I want to focus on deep cleaning I will focus on one room at a time", "but I want to encourage you guys to keep your space organized and clean during these times that we are staying at home it makes a huge difference and uplifting our

tostadas again", "so that is why gave them cereal", "and then I made the tostadas for my husband and I for breakfast", "so we have been trying to think ahead with the meals and meal plan in a way that

pick everything I highly recommend if you do not already have a garden to start thinking about that", "and I am gonna talk about that a little bit more in this video", "it is a wonderful feeling to have so much fresh produce we started with", "a very small garden years ago we did not know what we were doing and we have grown to have a much larger garden and we learned so much", "every single year right now I actually picked some rosemary I have been keeping it in my kitchen in a nice little pot there", "so I pulled some out of there", "it smells great", "and it looks pretty as well I

up", "small garden ideas garden beds also areas to create an herb garden if you have a small porch or backyard", "we started our garden on a very small porch when we very very first started in our

transplanting", "we also grow a lot from seed every season looks a little bit different and we have experimented with growing so many different types of things from berries to fruit trees but we have our favorites and we took a break over the winter", "so that is why did not have a big winter garden", "so our spring garden is gonna be coming up here soon and actually a lot that I took for the stock is essentially a mirepoix which is usually in the kitchen roughly chopped vegetables onions carrots and celery", "so we like to grow celery carrots onions those are kind of the basics we like

think you will use in the kitchen and what you will get use out of", "so once the veggie stock is done", "I let that cool down", "and I like to freeze whether I am making a chicken stock or a veggie stock I have these freezer containers and", "we have a small freezer just for our stocks great to have on hand for quick soups and recipes we have been getting a ton of rain", "but every once in a

soup here", "and I shared a little bit of this on my Instagram", "so that is why am of course gonna use part of the veggie stock for this veggie soup", "and then I am gonna save and freeze the rest for later now in a pan I am going to put my mirepoix in there which I was talking about", "earlier in the garden it is carrot celery and onion that is gonna go in my soup so that is why am starting with a little bit of olive oil", "I am adding the mirepoix I am gonna sweat that a little bit in the pan I am gonna add some rosemary from the garden to the mirepoix", "so that is why am gonna go ahead and chop that up", "finely add that I am gonna turn off the stove", "then I am gonna take the noodles over to the sink I am gonna drain those", "and then I am gonna add everything together in the same pot where the noodles were I am also going to add some veggie stock in there as much as I need", "the veggie stock has a beautiful color but it is a light blonde", "like I said if you roasted the vegetables you are gonna get a dark stock so it is really up to you", "there is a lot of different ways to make veggie stock I had a half a can of pureed tomato from the night before when I made Spanish rice for the tostadas so that is why am gonna actually add that so it does not go to waste", "so it is gonna be more like a minestrone broth you absolutely do not have to do that you could use the veggie broth if you want or a chicken broth or", "even you could find a broth at the store if you do not want to make it yourself", "but it is actually pretty easy", "and I actually also added thyme and rosemary so that is why added some herb to my stock as well", "and and then I added a little salt and pepper", "I am gonna add the noodles", "and then it is time to enjoy the soup very easy recipe I personally always like to have a little bit of acid", "so I add a little bit of lemon I usually do a squeeze or two of lemon", "and then some chopped parsley on top", "and it is a perfect

you can find at Target", "I like the products they are pretty reasonably priced", "and I you know so far so good", "I like them", "I am using their toner right now which comes with these reusable pads", "so you can put them in this mesh bag with a drawstring throw them in the washer and wash them I am not perfect about eco friendly", "I know", "I say that in my videos", "but it is cool when brands start forward thinking when it comes to that type of thing and reusable cotton pads", "are", "I think a good idea and makes it makes it easier when when brands are kind of thinking about that for you I am using my friends product", "this is my friend Gregory Dillon", "he has a serum called skin slept in we used to work together when I worked in the beauty industry in my 20s is a very invigorating serum that makes her skin look glowy", "and then I am using dr Perricone under eye cream he has the best under eye creams", "they are expensive products", "but I do like his products", "and I go in and out of using them", "but I am a big fan of his products I am using the argan oil from Trader Joe", "is right now currently as my body oil I switch up my body oils a lot to a kind of depending on what I have I am making sure my skin is hydrated and exfoliated right now because as I start to get a little Sun this time of the year my skin can get dry and uneven so making sure to apply oil on my body and then as of recently I have been using the Chi body oil", "it is a dry body oil", "so it is mostly for the scent chi products have this really beautiful gardenia scent to it", "so that is", "why am just gonna spray a little bit of that on my neck and decollete and down my arms", "and it again has a beautiful smell", "it is not particularly hydrating to be honest because it is a dry oil", "but I like to spray a little bit on top of my argan oil and I will take argan oil all down my body", "I try to be as consistent as possible with applying oil onto my skin", "my skin soaks it in and", "it helps my skin look supple and healthy and glowy versus you know dry and dull", "so that is definitely a big part of my routine and", "something I try to be consistent with", "so right now I am using this chanel foundation", "it is vital", "Lumiere you know what it is actually been making me break out a little bit especially if I am not good about washing my face", "so that is why do like that it is a light coverage", "and I like that it does give a little bit of a dewy finish", "but I am probably not going to buy it again to be honest I am using taught to use blender", "she actually sent this to me", "I think it is called the blend of Oh blender full", "and I have been liking it also another thing that you can throw in with the cotton pads and wash I have not washed it yet", "so that is why ca not say if it washes well", "but so far I have been using it", "I lost my Beauty Blender", "somewhere", "so that is why have been using that instead so that is what I focus on", "I try to keep it as minimal as possible at least for me", "you know", "I know some people have a way more minimal routine than even what I do", "but for me I have tried to simplify it to what make sense for me in my lifestyle", "I am starting to come up on the time of the year where I like to just let my hair dry naturally because it is starting to warm up", "so today it was like 75 degrees", "so that is why thought you know", "I will blow", "dry my bangs", "right now I do have bangs that I kind of swooped to the side", "but I am gonna let my hair dry naturally", "and I have been doing that a lot more lately", "the look is a lot more of a naturally dried hair", "so there is a little bit more frizz involved", "it is not so polished and perfect but to be honest like if I am not going out hanging out around my family", "I do not need to even have any makeup or make my hair look any specific way", "so that is why will brush my hair out with this blow dryer I have said before in other videos I am obsessed with this hair blow dryer", "I use it all the time so on days when I want to dry my hair completely or when", "though in the winter months when I want to dry my hair completely before going outside I always use that today I am gonna let my hair pretty much air dry", "I will put a little bit of serum in my hair a tiny bit because too much will weigh down my hair this also smells like vanilla because it was from the custom blend that I ordered from function of beauty", "and", "and then I will come back in a little bit and brush my hair because it does dry a little PC so that wraps up kind of my self care routine for the day try to get a workout in", "usually take a shower a little bit of makeup a little bit of hair but keep it pretty simple", "then I pop over to my studio to practice and if you are a music geek like myself or you play instruments you are practicing routine might look a little bit different than mine just depending on your goals so for me my goals are to improve my sight reading skills when it comes to reading charts both in guitar and piano and also writing songs so that is why kind of do a little bit of both during my practice time", "I practice reading chord charts and", "usually by time I have been doing that for a little bit I will start kind of messing around with my own ideas my own little riffs and sometimes I will put those ideas down in logic", "so this is the beginning of all my songs start here in my studio before I produce them with someone else over the last few years", "I was focusing on scales chords you know it really depends on your goals if you want to be a session player", "or you want to play in an orchestra most classical music you need to be able to read the sheet music", "the notes very very fast for me I have tried to focus over the last few years reading and writing chord charts for most modern bands", "I am gonna start playing in a cover band", "I am gonna start playing keyboard", "you usually read charts you need to know the time signature and be able to read a chord chart pretty quickly", "so that is pretty much what I have been spending my time focusing on for my practice time for right now", "at least so I try to spend a little time practicing music every day and trying to write as well", "then I am gonna brush my hair which will definitely make it look a little fluffier", "but as soon as I head outside it is a little windy out there", "my hair is gonna kind of be free by this point the weather is usually perfect and I am dying to go outside and work in the garden or in the yard", "I love it I love to listen to the birds", "and I collect the chicken eggs and really spend as much time until it is time to go pick up the kids and even when we bring the kids home", "we all love to spend the rest of the day outside if it is nice weather", "so we work in different zones of the property", "and we always have an ongoing landscaping project", "so that is why have been slowly adding decomposed granite which is what my husband is taking out of the truck right now and putting on to the ground and we are continuing to landscape our property and make it look as nice as possible front yard and backyard depending on the time I might edit before I do outdoor chores or even before I practice kind of depending on what is first priority", "but today I am actually editing this video", "and I took half of the footage on my iPhone and", "half of it on my Canon DSLR I import it into Final Cut Pro X", "and I usually like to do an intro and an outro", "and then I just edit it together", "and then I do a voiceover using my blue microphone which is what I am talking into right now", "and I usually try to edit videos at this time", "I also try to check in on YouTube and Spotify which by the way if you are on Spotify come", "follow me that is where you can hear my original music and some of my covers that I upload depending on what is priority you know", "if I have a project inside the home I might do that during the time frame that I was you know outside in this video", "but then it is time to go pick up the kids", "and then once we bring them home", "if it is a nice day we like to spend the rest of the day outside until it is time to start doing homework and getting ready for dinner", "so my son Isaiah he is actually asking to go see a B which is the neighbor dog", "and he is playing with my hair and", "the dogs are crawling all over me and they are all very excited to have the kids home", "so usually we take everybody out for a walk or a bike ride", "and we like to walk all the way around the neighborhood we go visit our neighbors", "and we go", "say hi to the horses it is like one of our favorite things to do on nice days Oliver loves to ride his bike and", "so every night at around 4 30 ish we go out for a bike ride a walk", "and he goes up this hill and rides down the hill on my neighbor is property and", "all of our neighbors are really friendly and very welcoming", "and so we ride down", "and we go", "say hi to the neighbor dogs and the neighbors if they are out and about you know we do not try to bother them", "but if they are out hanging out working on their property we say hi to everybody", "and he is gotten so good at writing down this one hill", "also it is fun because all of the neighbor dogs visit all of the different properties and it is one big giant family", "it is a family my TV forwards after our evening walk", "we come and just play on our property the boys especially as I say is getting older they imagine together and play a lot in the tree house", "and then we come in as the Sun Goes Down and start homework right before dinner my husband is a phenomenal cook so if he is home I definitely prefer for him to cook because he has a finesse with it and knows how to whip it together", "so if he is cooking I am definitely doing the dishes it is only fair", "so that is why am actually cleaning up before dinner", "and I like to kind of clean up while he is cooking", "and then I clean up whatever he cooked", "so that is why am doing the dishes right now while he cooks dinner and tonight he is making zucchini pasta which is one of our favorites it is not like zucchini noodles we actually just put grilled zucchini inside pasta and our boys like it as well", "we have been feeding them pretty eclectic", "since they were little so that is why are not super picky there is not too much that either of them wo not eat", "I started really young with Oliver and Oliver", "he is always been a open minded eater and", "then Isiah kind of copies whatever his brother does and wants to do whatever his brother does so that kind of made life easier at least in the food department", "Isiah was not the best sleeper but he is a good eater", "this is a recipe we like to make a lot you chopped up the zucchini", "it is a beautiful tomato sauce", "and then we put it on top of pasta", "we add a little Parmesan cheese", "the great thing about this is that you can make it vegan if you want to we eat meat occasionally", "but we try to do a lot of these type of recipes where they are you know mostly plant based", "so um we try to encourage our kids to eat zucchini", "sometimes we will do zucchini especially for growing it in the garden", "we have a lot of zucchini and rice", "and we try to include that into our recipes so now we are gonna kind of plate up", "everybody is excited everybody is stoked for dinner after dinner we wind down by either having bath time for the boys and reading a book to them and then putting them to sleep uh and then since I took a shower earlier I am gonna chill and usually watch an episode of something or a Netflix show or something along those lines

November", "and then we decided to tag along and book it as well in December", "we stayed at an all inclusive resort", "it was great for the kids we had a blast", "so I filmed some footage and thought I would put together a vlog and share our vacation with you so hopefully you guys enjoy this video I am gonna temper it traveling with kids", "can be a little intimidating but my number one tip is to just go for it and try it", "and you get used to it as you do it", "you know there is been times where I have definitely forgotten a thing or two", "it is really important for me though to make lists", "and I do feel like I am more prepared when we are traveling as a family versus traveling by myself", "I recently went on a business trip to Nashville", "and I feel like my mind was so scattered because I am a little bit better when it comes to planning for trips for the whole family versus traveling by myself", "but when it comes to a beachy vacation like this one a tropical vacation I just like to pack light so that is why take one side of the suitcase", "my husband takes the other", "I have tank tops shorts", "I have a few macrame pieces that I have collected from past vacations a Sun Hat", "also there are some dress codes when it comes to all inclusive resorts so that is why bring closed toed shoes and dresses like beachy dresses", "I get my bathing suits from Target", "so that is why usually get a new one every year", "they are super affordable and really cute", "and then I end up using the ones from years past over and over and over again", "so that is why usually bring a few I like bringing a few so that I do not have one tan line you know sometimes if you wear the same bathing suit you have one specific tan line", "so that is why like the different cuts and then obviously just really flowy comfy dresses for myself", "I keep it pretty simple", "I have this tinted sunscreen", "I liked it", "it did kind of get on my bathing suit", "but I did wash out", "so it was by Pacifica", "I have pajamas and then my toiletries", "and then for my boys I pack enough clothes for the trip and packing for a trip like this", "is a little easier as well because you know when we are going camping or when we are going to the cold you have a little bit more bulky items whereas tropical vacations are a little easier you have lighter weight clothes and things like that so that is why am packing their suitcase", "right now I am packing swimsuits shorts all that goodness", "I also have rash guards for both of them", "and then we packed a separate bag with their beach toys and floaties", "I always travel with my Herschel backpack when I am traveling with my kids", "especially it keeps my hands free", "it is a very comfortable backpack of course have my passport and the itinerary for our trip", "I have my wallet and then also in my backpack I packed lots of snacks for the kids depending on the timeframe of travel", "I also might pack a lunch but we were leaving really really early so that is why got breakfast at the airport", "I packed an independent study kit for my oldest Oliver we are going through some books and doing book reports and things like that", "so that is why were there for five days", "I did not make him do homework everyday", "but we did have a few days where we caught up on some work just to keep nice and sharp", "and I did bring my computer although I did not end up using it", "but I brought it in case", "I had to do anything work wise and so that was pretty much everything in my backpack", "this backpack is great for traveling", "it distributes everything nice", "so it does not it does not feel like it is weighing on your back and then also another tip is to make a photocopy of your passport email it to yourself", "it can make life a little easier in case you do lose your passport also I called my credit card companies to let them know I was traveling so that they did not put a stop on my credit card", "I am excited for Cancun let", "is do it", "hello I will say also it is easier to travel when you have someone with you to help you", "obviously Byron was with me very helpful but", "the snacks", "Byron packed those pillows we take those camping", "and it was helpful that we flew Delta which they have TVs and headphones so", "that made life a little easy because the kids loved it our first morning there", "the kids were pretty much ready to get up and go play in the water so before we went down for breakfast", "we would get them lathered up in sunscreen", "and then we d go down to the buffet they had a buffet for breakfast lunch and dinner which was amazing all the food", "was incredible", "and then they also had about five different restaurants to choose from for dinner", "so I d have like cappuccino and a nice breakfast in the morning lots of water and juices and they had green juice", "and then we d head over to the beach and we usually spend from like 10 30 till 2 00 or 3 00 at the beach", "the water was super warm and shallow so their grandparents were there as well", "so that is why all took turns going in and swimming with them", "and they wanted to swim all day long to be honest and they had a blast", "and here they are digging Oliver in the sand", "and they had this great little jumper in the middle of the ocean that the kids could go and jump off of", "and it was pretty shallow far out", "so the first day Oliver wanted to wear his floaties but as he got more comfortable he took off his floaties the second day and even this night on the first day", "and he was a pro in the pool he was doing flips", "and he improved his swimming skills so much on this trip so it was so fun", "the all inclusive makes it easy because we d spend the days at the beaches and at the pool", "and then we d go to one of the restaurants at night", "and you order whatever you want you give them your room number", "and you are good to go", "and they also had open bar", "so that is why get unlimited drinks which is nice for the adults we got a Cabana one of the days", "and just you know got a little break from the Sun", "did some homework took a little nap", "did some reading", "there was enough activities and excitement at the resort that we pretty much stayed there the whole time until we went on our excursion to Tulum one of the days we decided to do the excursion to Tulum which is the town on the Caribbean coast line of Mexico is primarily known for its beaches", "and it is well preserved ruin of ancient Mayan city", "so it was cool to see the ruins the kids liked it", "we went at the perfect time we went in the morning before it got hot and Oliver and Isaiah were experimenting with grandma", "is camera taking lots of pictures and they of course loved all the iguanas it was beautiful and a cool excursion to take", "and they also had like a little shop that we got a chance to go to", "and then we head back to the hotel for more fun in the water where d you think of that", "that was pretty cool", "huh was your favorite part", "did you get a good shot of the iguana with your camera", "I decided to check out the spa", "I did not get a chance to get a massage me and Byron", "we were there on Valentine", "is Day", "so we wanted to try to get a massage together", "but with the kids we just did not get a chance to do it", "but I did try the fish pedicure which was kind of trippy", "I will probably never do that again", "but I wanted to see what it was all about it kind of tickled and felt a little weird good job during the day they had Zumba by the pool that have bingo in the morning they had sunrise yoga", "it was so much fun and after like a little tequila I was dancing the boys were having fun", "and it was such a great time with the grandparents and looking around the beach and searching around and just having a total blast we did not want to leave all of us were very sad to go home after five days", "it was so much fun together as a family and honestly we really want to go back and do it again", "I would highly recommend all inclusive resorts and we had such a blast if you have ever been to Cancun Mexico", "I want to know which resort you stayed at and if you liked it", "but that completes our little vlog", "I hope you enjoyed it", "and I will see you guys in the next video bye"], "TrtImzvyL1E": ["hey guys welcome back to my channel today", "I am gonna be doing another garden diary video which you will be seeing more of these in the coming months because I like to spend a lot of time in my garden in the spring in the summer specifically although we have a garden usually all year round except for this last year we did take a little bit of a break so a lot of our garden goodness died and now before I left for my trip for Nashville", "I planted my herb garden", "so I am doing half and half transplant and planting from seed", "so that is why got most of the transplants from Lowe is and", "right now is actually a pretty good time at least where I live because it is starting to get a lot warmer", "they do have a lot of great options", "so right here I am planting lavender", "and I got about three of them", "I have a lavender in the front yard", "now I have both English and French lavender and lavender has so many different uses you can use it for recipes beverages for around the house", "and I will be sharing some recipes and some ideas in the coming months as my lavender grows for the transplants I am using a brand called Bonnie which is really great", "you can find it at Lowe", "is Home Depot some of these do come in plastic containers though which we try to recycle and use them for seedlings so if we do want to plant from seed we recycle them and we will use that for starters", "but they also have a biodegradable packaging basically the actual container that holds the plant itself you can stick directly in the ground and it will grow that is my preference but", "every variety does not come in that option for some reason", "so I have a few of those but", "then", "I also have the regular containers as well", "now they had a nice selection of herbs that I wanted to already grow in my garden and if you want to give your garden a little bit of a head start you can definitely use transplant", "so that is why am planting a few of my favorites of course", "I already started the lavender I planted citronella a few different varieties of oregano also a few different varieties of sage a few different varieties of mint", "and again if you follow my garden diary I am going to share with you guys how I use all of these herbs sweet mint I like for sweet mint tea during the summer months", "also experiment is great for tummy aches like for my kids", "my kids love tea and oregano is great for cooking so many different recipes I am also planting chamomile which we have had in the years prior", "so the last two years I absolutely love it", "it is one of my favorites", "not only is it a beautiful flower but when it blooms I will trim it and use it for bouquets of our flower arrangements in my home", "I will also trim and hang it up and let it dry and use it for tea so for each container I got about three to four of each herb that I wanted to transplant", "and then I did that and", "then also next I am taking some of our mulch", "this is mulch that we have from our property so whenever we have trimmed trees or", "you know basically we save it", "and we use it for", "I mean we are big fans of mulch and", "what we find helps with mulch is that we put a small layer on top of the soil like a very thin layer and it helps retain moisture", "it helps protect the plants and it makes the soil really soft so the soil does not get hard", "and it is benefitted our garden a great deal my husband is done a lot of research on mulching", "and he is a really big fan of it", "so that is why put a small layer on top", "and it actually looks really pretty to be honest", "I like how it looks so that is why am going to each bin", "I am gonna put a light layer of mulch on top of the soil", "and then I am gonna water everything", "and then I am just gonna keep an eye on everything we do have to set up irrigation still for the herb garden", "and it is gonna take several months for the herb garden to really begin to thrive", "but I did want to give it a head start with some transplants", "and then I am gonna pop over and grab some of my seeds", "and I am gonna go ahead and start planting from seed so that is why have my echinacea my echinacea did", "okay last year", "but it was not super strong", "so that is why am gonna try again this year", "I am also gonna try with arnica last year", "I had luck with calendula from seed", "I also I am gonna try Clary sage from seed I grew catnip last year", "which catnip makes cats crazy but it makes humans", "it is actually very relaxing if you do a catnip tea I like to mix catnip with chamomile", "and so last year I grew catnip", "and then I saved the seeds I actually harvested the seeds from the plant itself and saved them for this year", "so that is why am gonna plant those", "as well I do a very shallow hole and the soil has been prepped and watered and I am gonna put a few seeds in each little shallow hole and then cover it", "and then I am also going to cover that with mulch as well and again with seeds you have to be a little bit more patient because it takes time", "I found my seeds from Mountain Rose herbs which is a great place to get dried herbs teas but also great seeds and more rare seeds to be honest like it is a little hard to come by echinacea", "it is a little hard to come by the more medicinal seeds the chamomile and lavender and rosemary the more traditional", "are a little easier to find but mountain rose herbs has a really nice selection of all seeds but also kind of the more rare ones that I like to experiment with as you can see our aloe is going strong", "and we have had aloe probably for about five years now", "and it struggled for a while", "but it is been really happy this year", "I also plan to plant milkweed", "I have", "some milkweed seeds milkweed is what the caterpillars that become monarch butterflies like to munch on", "and so if you plant milkweed you are gonna have lots of beautiful caterpillars and you are gonna be able to see the process of them turning into monarch butterflies I will be planting the milkweed right by the Playhouse so that hopefully the butterflies will be flying in that area and my kids will enjoy that so that completes today is garden diary video", "obviously we are gonna have to be patient and see what everything looks like in the coming weeks and months because right now it is just whatever I transplanted", "and then the seeds", "but I am very excited for the coming videos", "and I absolutely love spring and summer", "it is my favorite place to be during those months", "so I appreciate

citric acid cornstarch Epsom salt baking soda", "I will put all of the ingredients listed in the description along with the ratios then I have my wet ingredients which is a little bit of water a little bit of coconut oil and then also I have some food grade food coloring which you can choose to make these white if you want", "but I thought for galentine is day it d be nice to make them pink so that is", "why really want to slowly mix in the wet ingredients to the dry", "if you pour it all in too fast the citric acid is actually gonna activate", "and then it will kind of disrupt the whole process", "and I will say I have made a lot of bath bombs in my lifetime", "and I have gone wrong with them a few times", "so the key for me is to mix really well and your consistency is of slightly damp sand like when you are at the beach", "and you are playing with the sand you can tell it has this certain texture not too dry", "not too wet also when you put them in the ice cube trays or whatever molds you have you want to", "you are pushing them down so that they are extremely compact", "then you want to let them dry usually overnight sometimes it takes two days", "but if you push them down they are really compact they will dry relatively quickly especially in a smaller mold like this one you definitely want to be careful when it comes time to take them out of the mold so that they do not completely fall apart now in this case", "mine were looking pretty good because I did get the consistency right", "but I have had a few times where I have taken them out and", "they have completely fallen apart", "so do not be discouraged", "if that happens I also put a little red rose on top", "so you have these beautiful red rose bath bombs", "also I forgot to mention that the essential oil that I used in my wet ingredients was", "red rose essential oil which smells absolutely amazing you can do any combination you want", "red rose lavender", "I like red rose and vanilla",

I am going to make some bubble baths this is pretty easy", "I have a little mini mason jar here that has half of filled up with water", "and then the rest is castile soap", "I also I am gonna put a

find this at Target", "I finished my time of the month", "so this is great for aches and pains", "it is great if you are not feeling well if you feel like you are getting sick or coming down with

looks glowy and healthy but to prevent any further breakouts I am using a clay mask", "I am gonna brush my lips", "I like to do this because exfoliating your lips makes them look a little bit more plump", "and then I am gonna relax in the tub and try to enjoy this time in the Epsom salt bath which again is really great for drying out impurities", "and I love a nice hot bath", "this is a little

important", "so next I am going to shave my legs with a little bit of conditioner", "and I am blanking on the name of this conditioner", "I think it is planet love beauty", "like I said I have a few different ones", "but I like to also use conditioner when I shave my legs and of course when I am shaving my legs in the bath which is actually pretty rare", "I do it at the very very end because I do

massage the areas of my body that have a little bit of cellulite", "and yes I have cellulite we all have cellulite", "it is not the end of the world I feel like the media makes such a big deal about it", "but if you want to try to massage that can help break up cellulite or some people believe it can help break up cellulite whether that is true or", "not either way massaging the skin is good for the skin overall again good for circulation", "it is similar to dry brushing in some ways", "so that is why like to do it if I am gonna be doing head to toe pampering", "and I like to do it with body oil or a really nice body cream", "so that is why have been mixing the well at a skin food with body oil for ever", "but it is been a minute since I have actually bought well at a skin food", "so that is why got some recently", "and I am gonna massage my skin with the massage tool you can find those at like the body shop", "you can even order them on Amazon", "they are super easy", "now my face

everyday looks a little bit different because I do try to have routine but also go with the flow of my life and my family and try to make it work", "but these are a few things that I do feel really make a difference so that is why wanted to start first with my morning routine", "I do think that having some type of routine in the morning makes a big difference and getting a good start to the day which I will be honest", "it does not always happen not every morning", "is as planned and pulled together as my videos", "but I you know last year I actually cut coffee out because the caffeine was making me jittery until my mom introduced me to these products", "and I started drinking the mushroom coffee I would get cravings for coffee so that is why would have decaf but with this one it has the caffeine but does not make me feel jittery so", "and also you know the mushrooms are a superfood so great for you of course everyone always asks does it taste like mushroom it actually does not taste anything like mushroom it just tastes like wonderful hot coffee", "I drink the lion", "is mane ground coffee", "it is a beautiful organic coffee that just tastes great in my opinion mushrooms", "are amazing superfoods", "they are very powerful for the body mushroom Coffee supports focus creativity memory concentration and for me I always like coffee because it improves my digestion that was actually the one thing I missed about having caffeine in the morning and cutting it out", "was that it did help a lot with my digestion in the morning and just keeping me on track I normally drink the ground coffee", "but they also have it needs to go packets which are instant", "so they are great for if I am gonna be running out the door taking the boys to school Byron", "and I actually switch off days so today he is taking the boys to school", "and I get to home and make myself a cup of coffee and have my little routine", "sometimes we will go together and then go to the gym after which I like to have as a part of the routine as well", "but today I am gonna take a shower I take a hot shower I even like to take my coffee into the shower sometimes", "and then when I get out I am just gonna do

do not get ready before I take them", "I get them ready and pack their lunches and take them and then come back and start my routine so today I am brushing my hair", "I am gonna let it dry naturally if I do not put my hair up into a bun or a ponytail it wo not get too knotted so just brushing it and let it dry naturally", "it will have like a wave", "but so that is why am getting ready and starting my routine", "and you know now that we are getting back into the routine", "it is nice to get ready every day even if I put on a little makeup and do my hair", "it feels nice to get out of pajamas and sweats", "and you know actually get dressed", "and today I had a meeting so that is why did have to get ready", "but before I pop to my meeting and start work I am gonna get ready", "and then I have a few things I want to do around the house", "the other thing I want to be honest with you about is I am bad at feeding myself sometimes and", "especially with breakfast I put the kids first", "I the kids are fed I", "their backpacks and their lunches and everything is put together and", "I get them to school", "and then I realize I have not eaten anything", "and I definitely wo not go to the gym unless I have eaten anything so that is why have been trying to make it a habit to like nourish myself and not forget about myself and so", "steel cut oats is actually one of my favorites", "I have", "this lavender blueberry almond milk that I got from Trader Joe is which is so good", "I add it to the steel cut oats", "I actually had this phenomenal steel cut oats when I was

is what I like to have for breakfast with some blueberries on top", "it is easy to make to be honest my kids love oatmeal as well", "so that is why have to make myself a little extra", "sometimes I got into the bad habit of not taking care of myself", "and I know as mom is we can do that so reminding myself to try to incorporate those healthy morning routines as much as possible", "so then once the boys are at school I try to get into the routine again of kind of cleaning up and tidying up", "it does feel like first thing in the morning", "it is a little chaotic to just kind of get everybody up get everybody ready", "and you know sometimes I forget to fix the bed sometimes there are toys and socks and clothes everywhere", "it feels like it is impossible to keep the house clean but a few minutes of decluttering fixing the bed organizing the house maybe starting a load of laundry that is kind of my next step in my routine in the morning", "I am a big believer in your environment really can be inspiring or uninspiring so just kind of cleaning up and tidying and to be completely honest and real with you guys", "I as of lately have had help cleaning my house", "I have someone come once a week even with somebody who comes though to be honest", "I am doing dishes laundry I am cleaning up every single day", "but it does help to have someone when I am busy with work", "and so you know everyday though even though I just like you know you got to fix the bed you got to pick up the socks", "pick up all the toys I try to tell I feel like I am constantly telling my kids to pick up", "but they seem to forget to pick up so um kind of creating that environment", "you know whether you have kids or even if you do not have kids to be honest if you let the dishes pile up", "or you let laundry pile up", "sometimes it is hard to get focused on a project when you know you have something else that needs to be finished", "so that is why just like to get that out of the way", "and then I feel like I have space to be creative and start work", "the other thing is that I love to add plants and empty spaces of the house plants always make me feel happier", "so I love them in my studio in my bedroom my office", "I", "you know the key is to", "you are taking care of them and you are watering them", "and you do not let them die", "I actually just got this new mirror from Amazon too",

that I like", "and you know I mentioned in my last video my gardening video that we went to New Mexico", "I was super inspired by the style", "so that is why got this fun new hat", "and I love these ring these fleamarket rings and this other ring I used to sell in my little boutique shop", "and I just like to be creative with how I express myself with the way that I dress I am heading to a meeting today", "so that is why thought you know", "it is pretty casual", "but I thought I would wear my fun new hat some rings", "and you know experiment with my style", "I like unique things like things that not everybody else is wearing", "and so I am at right now actually before I head out to my meeting", "I am gonna have a little quiet time I love", "even if it is 15 minutes of quiet time I am gonna drink my second cup of coffee and listen to the birds and hang out outside a tip that I have been trying to incorporate for many years", "but I kind of finally realized what it was is to make small promises to yourself every day and start small so that it is something you can realistically do so for me even if it does not happen every day I like to try to get quiet time in and more recently", "I just like to read I listen to audiobooks", "but sometimes if I want silence I read a good old fashioned book", "right now I am reading this Dolly Parton biography that a family member gave me for Christmas", "so that is why have an hour before I have to leave", "so that is why am gonna read for about 15 minutes", "read a chapter or two", "and then I am gonna go practice", "and then I am gonna head out to my meeting", "so this", "past Christmas my instrument collection grew significantly", "I had a piano and a guitar", "and I started keeping the promise to myself to learn piano five years ago to pick it back up actually because I played it as a kid and then this last year I picked up the guitar", "so my father in law he passed down a few of his guitars to me and", "I also got Guitar Center gift cards for Christmas", "so that is why bought myself instruments with my Christmas money", "and you know I am continuing that promise to myself and when you make little promises to yourself every day you look back in five years", "and you think wow look how far I have come you know", "and and so that is why made the personal promise to myself to practice a little bit every day and learn and learn something new and not be afraid of failing I am still a mediocre guitar player", "but I practice a lot", "and I am learning so much and trying to get better", "I take online courses and I will read books more recently with my guitar Center gift card", "I bought this lap steel for about 70 bucks I have been having so much fun with it", "but it is tricky", "and I have been

our yard", "and it is still technically winter because we have frost in the morning", "but we are excited to start working and waking up the garden for the spring months", "we had a small selection of things growing", "we had some artichoke we have our citrus trees and things like that", "but our herb garden we had to put on hold because we did not set up irrigation in the fall our eucalyptus tree had to be trimmed and", "all the boxes had to be moved and limbs fell", "and so now we are kind of wanting to wake it back up this spring", "we are amending the soil we are moving the boxes getting everything back in order", "I also have this succulents garden", "and I am gonna use these pots these hanging pots that I found in my Shack", "and I am just gonna fill them", "I am gonna transplant", "some succulents fill them up hang them in front of my studio in this video", "I am also going to share with you guys what we do with our grass to get it nice and even and looking pretty for the spring and summer months", "so I am gonna jump right into the video starting with that", "so right here my husband is pulling some seed and he is gonna be spreading that across the grass we also put plenty of seed in areas that are bare or patchy", "and then we take some of our compost which is our cover soil", "and we basically put that on top of the seed so that the birds do not get to it and eat it all", "and it kind of acts as a protection for the seeds and also the seeds can germinate with a little bit of cover soil so that is why do this a lot around this time of the year to really that the grass looks nice and even between the Gophers and the dogs", "you know we definitely have patchy areas of the grass so that is why try to work on that", "and when we do that consistently we can definitely have even really beautiful grass", "now we are moving over to the herb garden", "this was the herb garden which looked great last year but again like I said we have a pretty large eucalyptus tree that had to be trimmed", "so that is why had to move all of the boxes we started collecting these boxes when we lived at our old house", "but we still use them because they work really great", "you can find them at citrus tree nurseries eventually we would plant directly in the ground we are actually prepping the soil by mulching so underneath the boxes they are sitting on top of an area that is mulched and what mulch does is when you put mulch on top of dirt the dirt underneath slowly over time throughout the seasons becomes very soft and moist and workable where the dirt on an area that is not mulched is just hard hard as a rock especially in our area so that is why will be able to plant in the ground in the next few years but for now we have these boxes we love them", "and so what we are gonna do", "is they are even in terms of how far apart they are from each other that we have pathways in between them and then in the next few weeks you know after it starts to get a little bit warmer we will plant our seeds and the goal will be to have a really lush beautiful full herb garden come spring and summer we do not need them to be perfect", "but we want them to be as even and straight as possible just so that it is aesthetically pleasing", "so we use a string to to help us we can push them up against it and that the line is straight for all the boxes our aloe vera", "it is so funny we had that aloe vera plant for a while", "and it started small", "and it would die and then come back and die", "and then it is just thriving right now", "and it is one of the ones that survived", "so that is why have the aloe", "but we are gonna have to replant everything else so once the boxes are lined up straight now", "we have to straighten up the mulch underneath all of the boxes and make those as even as possible so that they are not wonky so that is what we were doing together", "and so it definitely took a little bit of prep work to make it look really pretty and to get everything organized and ready for when we do plant or transplant our herbs", "it is so worth it for me all the work that leads up to having such a beautiful lush herb garden it is one of my favorite places to reflect and sit and enjoy the spring in the summer", "so that is why absolutely love it", "and we love to utilize the ingredients as well that we grow for food and for", "I like to make remedies and things like that so that is why enjoy it", "and so we are excited to get it back up and running again", "so once we evened out all the boxes it was now time to amend the soil within the boxes so that is why had to go through and pick out any dead leaves and mulch luckily", "I could throw that on the ground because the ground is mulch right now and again like I said that really helps the soil underneath so that we can actually plant directly into the ground in the future in this area of the property so that is why have a hand tiller I am removing any dead roots and that I am also tilling the current soil that is in there", "I am gonna add some new fresh compost to the mix and then continue to till so that all of the boxes have the same amount of soil", "as well the soil comes up to the same point in the boxes that helps the overall aesthetic of the garden as well and how things grow so going out and cleaning out each individual box and prepping the soil now once we finished all of this we had soil that is ready to go so now we can plant when we are ready we can transplant when we are ready and if you see the little black tube that is in the box that is going to be irrigation", "so we are gonna set up irrigation this year as well so that we do not have to hand water all of these herbs it is hard to keep it alive when you have to leave or go out of town", "and you do not have irrigation setup", "so we usually have irrigation set up to a timer so that the timer pops on it", "waters the garden", "and then we have to keep an eye on it every day", "but it keeps it minimal upkeep", "now I am just kind of removing all the roots and prepping all of the soil for each box getting it all ready to go", "and now when we are ready we can plant or transplant our new herbs of course anything that is dead or that we pull we put back into compost so all of that goes into an area that we compost for the future and it creates a beautiful soil so that is why am going to keep all of these roots for the compost back when we moved into this house", "we had a old fountain that was not working that we kind of tore down", "and we had the bottom of it left", "so we put a few succulents plants in there", "and it overflowed it turned into this out of control succulents", "garden the great thing about succulents is once it is happy it just thrives and goes crazy what i am doing here", "is trimming my succulents garden", "and then i am gonna transplant that into these hanging planters that I found in my Shack", "so when I was putting away my Christmas items I saw these and thought oh I need to pull these back out for the spring right here I have compost vermiculite and sand now there is debate whether vermiculite or perlite is better for succulents but we use about a handful and a half of vermiculite a handful and a half of sand", "and we mix that with compost or soil", "and then I am gonna put that in these hanging planters", "and then I am basically gonna give my succulents a haircut and Transplant the leftovers into these hanging planters but first I am gonna prep the soil so that this is a happy place to live for the succulents", "and they love sand and vermiculite mixed in with the compost so for these sized containers", "a handful and a half of each is probably perfect succulent is not like to be over watered here", "we have a pipe that has condensation", "so it kind of it leaks", "a little bit so that is why actually put this watering", "can underneath it", "and we collect the water we use that water for our succulents", "so every few days it fills up and we use it for our succulents garden and that keeps our succulents happy I decided that each planter would have a different variety of succulents in it", "and I trim and leave enough room on the stem to stick into the soil and really allow it to create new roots in these planters you know the garden is going to get a little haircut", "but then I also can reuse the succulents and put it in other areas and let it thrive in other areas and", "it looks pretty to have beautiful green planters hanging in front of the studio I found these pops 50 off at Rite Aid for 10 bucks apiece", "and we took a road trip to New Mexico to visit my mother in law that is where my husband is from Albuquerque New Mexico and we visited we visit Santa Fe when we go there", "and I am so inspired by Southwest art and style", "there were so many things that I noticed while I was there from you know the music to the art", "the jewelry and the turquoise I love all of that", "it is very eclectic", "and I just resonate with the art in the style over all these pots", "felt very eclectic and something I might see in New Mexico", "so and the fact that there were 10 bucks I decided to trim my garden of course because it was overflowing and then just kind of moved my succulents into other areas I wanted to put a lot of plants in front of my music studio because I like to pop out of practicing or working and come out and sit out in the Sun and just listen to the wind chimes and look at the plants so this particular pot is usually for strawberries", "but I thought that this would make a pretty succulents container so that is why will have to see how well", "this does", "but I am pretty confident I can care for succulents better than I have in the past I have definitely had to learn succulents and", "what they like", "but I am confident the ones in front of my studio will do well", "and so this is an example of something we would try to tackle in a day", "while the kids are at school we try to get out there and work together and get as much done as possible", "and we do not do it every day", "but we choose a day that works for both of our schedules and we try to make it happen because we do love the garden so much", "and it is so fulfilling and inspiring", "so that is why hope you enjoyed this video there will be more gardening videos

you have sensitive skin I would research on his website a little bit more", "I know that it is worked well for my skin", "I have combo skin", "and then I am using this product by versed it is a

am going to mix that", "until it creates an icing consistency in my mixer I am adding a portion of egg and then vanilla extract and peppermint extract and that is gonna give these cookies a little bit of a peppermint flavor so if you d prefer you can omit peppermint", "but I personally like them in these cookies", "I am gonna slowly add in the flour and salt and", "then once that is done fully mixing I am gonna pull the dough out and divide it into two", "I am gonna have one side remain the same color", "and then I am gonna add some food coloring some red food coloring to the other portion of the dough the dough then also needs to be chilled for an hour up to 24 hours", "so that is why am going to chill wrap and chill that", "and then when I bring it out I am going to start making the

little bit of coconut oil that is gonna help the chocolate to harden once you are done dipping the balls into the chocolate so once the chocolate is completely melted I am gonna start dipping each one

gives you a few ideas if you have guests coming to stay with you soon so the first step always is to make sure I have clean towels and clean sheets", "so whenever I know it is like the day before family is gonna be here", "I just strip all the sheets and towels and I do usually two loads of laundry so one for the bedding and one for the towels", "and they have fresh clean bedding which I feel like", "is pretty standard", "right", "I mean I feel like most people know that", "but that is definitely the first thing in my routine if I ca not get to anything else of course", "I am just gonna

sometimes the nights are cold and actually the last few nights we have been out of power because of the wind so when they actually got into town we did not even have any power so that is why could not heat the house kind of crazy", "so that is why actually did have to end up using the blankets", "so I always have fresh blankets sheets and then also some extra options", "and then every time a guest leaves I usually will it kind of depends sometimes I will fix the bed and wait to wash the sheets until I know if someone is coming over again because sometimes when the sheets sit there and nobody is laying on them that gets kind of dusty", "so that is why always like to do sheets the day before I know", "someone is gonna be coming", "so that is why am gonna fold them", "I do I try to fold my sheets under I", "am not perfect with my sheets", "like I know some people that iron their shades", "and I feel like I do", "not I am not that on top of it", "so that is why am happy with the clean sheets", "and then I always have to dust because the the headboard gets really dusty", "the side table gets dusty and I have done videos in the past where I have done more extreme versions of guest prep like snacks and water and treats and things like that but for the most part my routine is that I everything is clean and this room right now is pretty bare", "I had a few plants in this room but one of them died so that is why need to kind of come back in and rethink the decorating in this room but for now just cleaning off the side table", "I will put some flowers and a few magazines that are relevant and current another thing that you can add is water bottles or cups for water usually like the day that they are gonna get there you can put fresh water with lemon in there if you wanted to", "so it kind of just depends on what you have time for there is like the basics", "and then there is you know adding a little extra touch this I found at Costco", "I went on a Costco trip and it was the softest blanket of life", "and I thought I want to buy this", "I want to buy one of these for the guest bedroom", "and so I am actually gonna", "put that on the bed", "and it is a nice extra

like Isaiah is potty training right now", "so I have like a little potty there", "and there is always dinosaurs and toys and nerf guns all over the floor and things like that", "so that is why clean the bathroom first and foremost", "and then I always try to do some type of guest basket I have done a few different types of baskets in the past", "I do not always have a basket in that bathroom

it is brand new and a towel", "and then I will set that out with fresh flowers", "and then I add toiletries and candles so fresh hand soap shampoo and conditioner things like that there is a bath and Bodyworks that opened by my house and to be completely honest I have not even shopped at Bath Body Works in years just because I do prefer to go for little healthier options when it comes to candles beeswax or soy wax", "but my friend I go to her house for Bible study", "and she had the welcome home candle for Bath and Body Works and it smelled so good that I made an exception", "and I am not perfect about that", "anyway I do not use everything chemical free", "but I do try to", "mostly I would say 75 of the time choose candles that are a little bit healthier or diffuse essential oils which I know are a healthier option this welcome home candle though it smells so good", "so that is why did go into Bath and Body Works", "and I got one", "and then I think the other ones called farmhouse or fall farmhouse that one smells good too", "so this is the first time I have used used Bath and Body Works candles and like maybe eight or nine years it is been awhile", "but they do smell good and if you like", "Bath Body Works check out those scents especially around this time of the year it made the house smell amazing", "so the final thing that I do especially when I am doing a more quick guest prep is I do a grab and go station for coffee and also breakfast", "so that is why do bananas you know corn flakes or puffs", "I do I just kind of put everything out", "so that is why do not feel like they have to go search for things especially when it comes to breakfast and", "then with coffee I set everything out when it comes to coffee so that is why will put out the French press

been using their service for years and", "I am gonna jump right in and share", "I think social media and our phones have become such a big part of our lives and even if we have busy lives sometimes if we feel bored it is easy to get lost on our phones", "so limiting screen time is something I try to do your phone actually allows you to block certain apps and customize how often you do screen time if you are good about not checking your phone then obviously you do not need to do this but for me sometimes I will limit it like the time I pick up my kids from school until they go to sleep at night I will block out my apps or I will limit it to an hour or two or three hours a day obviously because social media is a part of my job I have to be on it for a certain amount of time but limiting it can be really really helpful", "I enjoyed being homeschooled through junior high in high school", "and it taught me the discipline of teaching myself the things that I am interested in I", "have always said that one thing I love about technology is that you have access to educate yourself and one thing I like to do is listen to audiobooks and I usually listen in the car on the way to pick up

just encourages me to do even more saving and a little less spending", "so that is why you know I like listening to it", "and you can start listening with a thirty day audible trial you can choose one

is so many resources to educate yourself on topics that you are interested in the great news", "is that even though classes and teachers are really great you can learn a lot through books you know have a beautiful pair of books that I was actually gifted for the holidays that I have not had a chance to go through", "but I definitely plan to you know in the near future when I have time which is everyday watercolor", "and then a great sketching book that an artist friend of mine gave me", "I used to take art classes as a kid", "and I loved them with all the extracurricular classes that I like to take our music and horseback riding lessons and things like that it added up and my family", "you know struggled financially so I would pay for them myself because I worked", "but then I started realizing", "you know I could go to the bookstore and rent out books and in the last few years especially I have been trying to kind of get back into the things that I used to love as a child that were more simple and things that made me happy so less about more things", "and more", "how can I be creative and use my creativity to bring forth joy", "there is a lot of great books that you can purchase or you can rent from the library you can also go on to youtube and watch videos", "these are really cool", "these are watercolor sheet papers and it comes with this pen here", "it is small enough to fit in your back pockets but even in a purse", "and you know take to go", "so that is why want to experiment a little bit more with watercolor in the near future", "but I have been focusing more on sketching things that I find inspiring along the same lines finding peaceful hobbies hobbies that keep you in the moment something that you really love", "so that is why actually I have not done a puzzle in a really long time", "so I am making myself a cup of the hot herbal fall team", "and then I got this puzzle on Amazon", "I think for a few dollars it was a fall puzzle", "and I thought that it might be something fun to do and it reminded me when I was younger my mom for her birthday all she wanted to do", "was take a puzzle up to Big Bear and get a cabin with our family",

a puzzle sounds amazing", "so mom", "that was such a great idea", "I ended up just getting this puzzle because I thought you know what why not I am gonna try it", "so I got this puzzle I kind of started with the pieces", "and I started putting it together myself", "and then what was funny", "is", "Byron came over and started kind of working on it a little bit with me", "and then all over when

done a puzzle in years", "so it is definitely not a regular habit for me to sit down in the middle of the day and do a puzzle", "but I got it started in the middle of the day a little bit", "and then we all kind of worked on it a little bit later", "and then me and Byron worked on it a little bit at night", "and you know it was really great", "it felt peaceful and enjoyable again with an interest of mine like music I took classes as a child here in their piano guitar I dabbled in it", "and then I studied music in college", "but if you do not practice and stay on top of it", "you can definitely kind of lose", "you know what you had worked so hard to gain through those classes", "so about five years ago I mentioned that I got a piano", "and I started building my music room and really started studying and practicing", "and now I like to take a lot of online courses and there is a lot of great apps with reasonable price points musicians who offer classes and specify in certain genres", "so that is why take a blues piano course and a blues guitar course", "and then I have been dabbling a little bit in bass and harmonica", "and I try to practice as often as I possibly can with my schedule", "another habit that I have been doing pretty much my entire life", "but I did not really realize it was a habit until recently", "is journaling", "you know whenever I get an idea or a thought whether it is a lyric or an idea for a video or something that I want to work on I will write down my goals I will do one year goal six month goals five year goals ten year goals", "I find that usually when I look back a lot of those things have come to fruition so baby steps are really important and journaling helps a lot I am someone who definitely has a very busy mind", "and I like to keep my mind very creative and busy", "and if I do not I tend to think about worst case scenarios or get anxious and", "so that is why know it is very important for me to keep my mind busy with",

whole house or organize the whole house I will start with one room or one space and today I was organizing the closet something that is become really crucial to me especially over the last year", "is quiet time there are definitely seasons in life", "and you know I used to have to squeeze everything into my kids quiet time or nap time", "and I definitely did not have time for all of these things

right in", "okay", "so as I said I ordered the e Salon custom hair color set so it is made to order customizable home hair color you go on you", "take a little quiz", "you upload a picture of yourself", "you have access to your own personal colorist to help tweak your color which actually they contacted me and said they recommended me going a little bit more gradually dark because I chose a pretty dark color", "and so they said to go a few shades darker rather than", "all the way so that is why took their advice so it comes with everything you need to color your hair", "and like I said you upload a picture of yourself and the color that you currently have plus the color you are trying to achieve", "and then you speak with a colorist to that they are blending the perfect color for you so like I mentioned", "earlier they recommended that I gradually go darker around this time of the year", "I usually do go to my stylist and have them darken my hair do an all over color", "and then just do like a really deep chocolate very very dark chocolate brown color", "and I like going darker", "I actually think it looks pretty but in the summer this is my natural hair color and it is lighter at the ends", "and it is a little bit of a lighter brown than what I will be by time I am finished with this so that is why am gonna section off my hair", "it comes with very detailed instructions that I followed to a tee", "I sectioned my hair off into four different sections", "and then I began to mix the color for my roots", "so a stain shield came in the kit", "so I am gonna start putting that around my hairline making sure not to put it on my hair but around my ears and anywhere where the color could end up", "but I had great luck", "it did not honestly", "I did not have any leftover stains anywhere", "and then I am gonna start mixing the color for my roots and I am gonna start applying that on to my roots", "so the way that they explained it in the instructions was to brush onto the roots and then massage it with my hands down to kind of like the middle portion of my hair so that is why followed the instructions like I said to a tee", "and did that all around my roots", "and this is obviously even more beneficial if you have grays I do not currently have", "Gray is", "but I still wanted to do an all over consistent color rather than", "what my hair is right now which is kind of hard to see", "but it is a little darker on top", "and then it gets lighter at the bottom", "okay", "so after I was finished I put a timer on for 10 minutes which is what the instructions said and then after 10 minutes I came back", "and I mixed my color for my ends and then followed the instructions to apply the color on to my ends", "and I left that on for 5 minutes the instructions recommended for added color and shine to add water to the leftover", "ends color and then go into the shower and put the rest in my hair and just massage it for a minute or two and then wash out the color", "and I stood in a way in the shower that the color just rinsed down the drain and did not get all over me", "but", "but it was really really easy totally easy to follow and since

easier than what I always imagined", "it would be", "I was always very intimidated", "but this turned out amazing so that is why am actually gonna use the shampoo that came with everything else", "and I am gonna wash my hair", "and then I am gonna blow dry my hair with my Dyson which is what I use every single day", "well whenever I do blow dry my hair", "sometimes I let my hair dry naturally",

pretty brown color so that is why am gonna go ahead and and start blending that into the corners and underneath of my eyes", "also I apologize because when I was filming this video the light the clouds just kind of kept going over the Sun and the light kept going in and out underneath my brows", "I am gonna use a color from the same palette called fly by and then a little bit more of the

have two different mascaras that i go back and forth between one from lorac and one from Laura Mercier", "I love them", "both equally I keep one and the makeup bag in my car and one on my makeup

pray have it pretty bare in the summer months", "a few candles and our little chicken our little chicken there", "but I am gonna move things around a little bit", "I am gonna add a wreath", "like I said the fireplace mantel is usually pretty bare during the summer months sometimes I will have an herbal wreath that I will put up and keep it simple but since we are not using the fireplace I

percent off at Hobby Lobby and a few other decorations I am adding some of the pumpkins that we grew and that we harvested and every year I do it completely different", "I kind of change up my theme every year if you will and judge it and make it look", "however i think is pretty sometimes if it is too cluttered", "i will remove things or add", "or i just kind of change it up depending on what I think looks good in the moment", "so I am adding a few of the rustic pumpkins I have a collection I had one fall box", "and then I bought a few things in the 40 off sale at Hobby Lobby to add", "so I will start a second fall box", "but I am trying to keep it minimal", "so that is why do not overdo it on the decorations I to use what I do have", "and then I love those kind of loose fake leaves you can find them at Michael is or Hobby Lobby just to add as like filler and when there is a lot of different things going on", "I try to keep candles in a really safe spot obviously or use fake candles

absolutely smells amazing and it is made completely from natural ingredients", "so I I put that into a container of Oz of some type", "and then I usually have a pumpkin and that is on the side of my fireplace next I am moving into the guest bathroom", "this is the bathroom right next to my kitchen", "so the majority of guests use this one I am using the Honey Crisp apple diffuser", "that was also

centerpiece", "and I really really loved", "I think it was probably one of my favorite tablescapes I have ever done", "it is on my channel this year", "I am kind of doing a similar", "but I am doing two separate centerpieces because I have these glass vases that I got from Hobby Lobby also 40 off", "I do not have flowers the entire season on my dining room table", "but I usually like to choose a time when I know I am gonna have friends or family over or if you are having a dinner maybe like a harvest party or maybe even for Thanksgiving", "I mean there is so many different times in which you can do it", "Trader Joe is has pretty affordable flowers", "but I definitely do not have them on the table the entire season", "but these are a few ideas for even if you are having a fall wedding

to kind of go based on my own eye", "and what I think looks pretty", "and I usually trim them and try to they are all the same height", "and I usually remove the leaves and try to get it as clean as possible last year in one of my fall DIY videos", "I shared a tip about collecting pinecones and adding some cinnamon essential oil on them and then also you can add cinnamon sticks also maybe some pumpkin decor and fake leaves", "and they make a really pretty centerpiece", "so that is why am gonna actually put this in the center", "you can paint pinecones as well to have different colors to give it a little bit of variety and", "then on either side of that I am gonna put the flowers", "and then I love these birch candles I have fake ones", "and I have real ones as well", "and I bring those out throughout the year because they work during Christmas time they work pretty much", "you can use them in the summer", "they are great", "and I use them year after year the fake ones are nice too because I keep those closer to the flowers to prevent any type of fire hazard I am putting our white pumpkins that we had in the yard that we harvested", "I am gonna put those on the table as well", "and then I will probably cook those up you can cook them just like you d cook squash", "so maybe in a few days I am gonna put some of the fake leaves down", "so this is obviously a very large table scape you can always scale down if you have a small table", "my table is pretty big so if I am gonna have a buffet style type get together usually we will move stuff like this if everybody is gonna be sitting around the table because you want to see each other and converse", "and but this is also just nice to have on the table during the fall months as decoration since my table is pretty large I ended up adding some additional items and these are these kind of rustic pumpkins I got from Hobby Lobby last year", "and so this is quite an extravagant table scape", "and I think last year is was as well", "but I always enjoy doing extravagant table escapes", "also I picked up a few things for the boys to play with while I was decorating", "these are fun because you could peel them off and stick them on to the window so that is why gave all over that job while I continued to decorate this is in front of our window", "we have the coffee bar to the right", "and then our dishes are underneath", "and I put welcome to our home and a candle", "so just a little something there to add some is usually pretty bare there unless I have flowers and then moving on to the front porch which is one of my favorites", "I always have seasonal flowers I like", "to get those from Lowe is they last really well if you are consistent with watering them", "and then I am gonna put a sign I do not have too many signs", "but I have had this sign that says pumpkins corn maize and hayrides which i think is really funny", "I put that in there", "and then a few pumpkins again similar to this I will usually leave the pumpkins out", "and then I will use them for seeds or cook them up my door", "is so dirty right now", "and", "I also got a new match at the 40 off sale that says thankful", "so that is why went ahead and put that down", "and then I cleaned off my door because we live on a dirt road", "and it is dirty all the time there is always dust and mud and dirt everywhere", "so that is why try to keep it as clean as possible", "but I thought that these pumpkins I love the real funky looking pumpkins", "and then I have my fake birch candle that I mentioned", "and then this is also great these lanterns because I got those at Target and you can use those during Christmas time as well", "so I use those through throughout the entire year", "this is a pretty wreath", "I got from Trader Joe", "is it was a few dollars", "and it is actually real leaves", "so this one is pretty as well", "so I kept it simple for the front porch", "I did a terrible job painting my front door so that is why apologize I have actually been meaning to fix that", "but I have not done it yet", "so so the front porch was pretty simple", "but I did want to make sure I decorated it this year", "and then for my master bathroom this is kind of segwaying into upcoming videos", "I usually have lavender", "and I kind of switch that up during the fall season on my bath tray", "and then I have my lush fall themed bath bombs", "and then a few of the more soft plush pumpkins", "so that is why usually always decorate that as well so that was it for my first round of decorating", "I may add a few bits and pieces here and there", "and I will definitely do more fall videos", "but this was the first one", "and I hope you enjoyed it and have you decorated for fall", "yet I gotta say it was pretty hot so

share with you guys my outdoor chore routine", "or I guess what I was up to today", "so that is why are gearing into the fall months", "it is still pretty hot outside here in Southern California", "so it was like 90 to 100 degrees on this day", "so that is why was in shorts and getting work done", "but we are kind of prepping for fall not in the garden and for what we are gonna grow but just all around the yard", "I thought I would show you what I am up to today which chores are always different depending on the day and the week in the month", "but this was what I was doing today", "so on our property we grow food in different areas", "we have about 3 acres under 3 acres", "it is all gated in", "but we have an inner and outer portion of our property", "so the inner portion is kind of like a more traditional backyard where we have grass and then we have our culinary garden in our herb garden this area", "right here is", "it is on kind of the outskirts of our property", "it is next to the chicken coop", "so it is a little farther away from the house", "we also did not have garden beds for this area so what we did was we prepped the soil we used our compost", "and we did some tilling and turning and prepping it this season before", "and then we did large lines and experimented with watermelons squash zucchini and pumpkins", "we had much better luck this year with pumpkins", "than we did last year we had no luck with pumpkins last year", "but this year we got about six or seven large pumpkins", "and then we got these small white ones which they are all edible", "you can cook them the same way you would cook squash", "I am gonna use them to decorate", "and then once I feel like it is time", "I am gonna pull them and use them to cook with them", "so this is an example of kind of the rabbits eating away at the pumpkin so they are not perfect looking but that pumpkin looked pretty nice", "and then I got a cool green pumpkin and", "then lots of watermelon we got over a hundred pounds of zucchini so that is why were eating and donating and sharing a lot of zucchini", "so today the plan was to pick whatever was left over so that is why got a nice little harvest we picked everything", "and then we just wanted to mow all the vines and everything that was left over before we did that we had to move the irrigation", "so we are kind of moving the vines and everything out of the way of the irrigation", "then we are gonna move that then we are gonna let the chickens come over and enjoy whatever they want there is um lots of little bugs and little leftovers for them to enjoy", "so they are gonna go at it for a few hours", "and then once they do that we have all the leftovers that go into the compost and", "the compost is what we use as soil to feed not our garden beds our pots anytime we want to grow anything we have a rich compost that we have been working on for the last few years", "so we are adding to that", "and then we can also use that in this area come spring when we begin to plant seeds for what we want to grow in the spring", "so right here you can see us moving the irrigation and over to the right there", "we are starting to grow a few trees we have maybe about eight trees right now", "and we are kind of experimenting with the beginning of an orchard going up the hill when the chickens are out free ranging that is a good time for me to clean the coop which needs to be cleaned out every few weeks", "it definitely starts to smell and attract flies", "I am gonna collect the eggs", "and then I am gonna clean out all the hay that is inside of the chicken coop right now which also has a lot of poop", "and we have these little containers that they lay in so", "that is why go in there every morning", "and they sit in there", "and they lay their eggs and then they kind of let you know", "like I finished laying my eggs um", "and then they go out", "so all of them are out free ranging right now", "so I am taking all the old hay and the chicken poop with it", "this is actually really great for your compost because it is rich with", "nitrogen chicken poop is awesome for compost which ends up being what you use for soil for continuing to grow anything in the future so none of this goes to waste it all gets used to continue to grow and in terms of the eggs we get about a dozen eggs a day some days more some days less", "and we donate we have been selling them to local food trucks", "my husband has a few chef friends that like to buy farm fresh eggs", "we consume them as well and give them to family and friends and then sometimes we feed them back to the chickens it kind of depends on how many you have I am putting fresh hay inside of the chicken coop", "which is what I do every time I clean it out", "so there is no more poop in there", "it is all fresh hay", "I cleaned out their little laying baskets and put fresh hay in there", "and it is all ready to go", "I d say this takes me an average of like a half an hour to get it nice and clean", "and then it smells so much better", "and it is ready to go so", "this portion right here is the inner portion of our backyard", "and I think I have shared in previous videos that my husband extended the fence line to make room for our garden", "and then he has like a little thin fence up to prevent rabbits from completely destroying it", "so the fence was previously right where the garden starts so that is why can see the little area where the garden starts that was where the fence was before and now it is behind the garden and when we first moved into this house we did have kind of like gardeners who would come and just mow the lawn and clean up leaves and things that have shed from the trees", "but as we kind of started doing this more ourself we ended up deciding to do the chores ourselves on the weekend", "so Byron always mows the lawn every weekend", "and we clean up the tree trimmings once again everything that we clean up gets used somehow on our property so with the grass we use it as mulch and also with the tree trimming so like the eucalyptus tree", "we have a few different compost piles so that is why have been starting to build different piles for different areas of the property", "so that is why have like a mulch pile", "we have our traditional compost so everything kind of gets reused nothing gets thrown away", "and recently we actually had all of our trees trimmed", "and so that is why have this pile here of all the wood chippings which work great for around the property as mulch", "and then you can see all of the leaves that drop from the trees that it ends up all over our back porch", "so we kind of blow it into a pile and then pick it up and clean it up and put it into our compost or into our mulch pile both of us were raised in Southern California", "neither of us were raised on property so this is kind of new to us and something we have grown to learn and love and during the summer", "Byron and I definitely do our fair share of chores in flip flops and sandals things will start to cool down a little bit", "and of course we wear boots and depending on where we are working certain areas of the property", "we pretty much do wear boots just because it is a little safer in terms of critters and anything that could be stepped on but", "so right now we are in sandals cleaning up the inner and outer portion of the property", "and this we actually have not seen we have seen one snake on our property the entire time we have lived here", "and it was a non venomous snake", "so that is why have yet to see one", "but that is always a possibility as well", "so that is why am cleaning up everything that he blew into a pile I am just picking it up", "and I am gonna carry it on over to the back of the property where we have our little mulch", "pile the last thing that I have to get done today is cleaning out the chairs and the table that we have out in front of our herb garden which we did a lot of summer dinners outside", "normally I would put this away but we do not have harsh winters here obviously in Southern California", "we do get some rain", "but these are weatherproof and they need a good cleaning every few weeks to every few months", "kind of depends", "I keep an eye on it and if we are eating out there more consistently", "I am obviously keeping it clean", "we are gonna extend it", "right now we are adding the inner piece to extend it which this was last year", "I put this away in our Shack", "and then we brought it out in this summer", "and we had a bunch of summer dinners so it is still pretty warm", "so that is why might have a few more dinners before it starts the rainy season", "and then I am gonna treat it with mineral oil and that is gonna keep the table looking nice for a long time we have had this table for a while", "and it is held up really nice especially for an outdoor table", "so I usually wipe and wash", "and then I am going to dry it", "then I am gonna add the mineral oil", "I use the mineral oil that we use for our cutting boards and again that helps it makes it look like a brand new table this table", "I got", "a lot of you asked me", "I got it at kind of like a local back", "when we lived in Westlake there was an outdoor", "I think called patio world", "maybe no I ca not remember the name I will try to look it up for those of you who are interested it was a local store", "and we got this table", "and it is held up", "really well I love the lanterns I kind of move those around depending on the time of the year usually in the fall", "I will move them to the front of the house for winter for Christmas time", "but I like one on the table with a candle I usually put some type of bug repellant candle because usually when we are out there having dinners during the summertime we have a lot of flies and bugs and things like that", "so so that completes today is video", "I have had so many requests specifically to see how I clean the chicken coop but also just kind of updates on what we are growing and kind of what my routine looks like in terms of chores", "so that is why wanted to share with you guys", "and I hope

gadgets and things like that on occasion but", "for the most part I keep my routine pretty simple so today I am gonna share with you what that kind of looks like on any given day", "so that is why am gonna start first with my morning routine which consists of a few steps the first being to wash my face a very simple routine of cleansing your skin morning and night", "makes a huge difference and of course if you have a cleanser", "you really like which", "I like this one from fresh I have been using it on and off for years", "I kind of change it up depending on what my skin is feeling", "but this one is a nice gentle cleanser", "and I mean there is been times where I do not wash my face morning at night because especially those years when my kids were newborn", "I felt like I was in a fog", "and I was not getting good sleep", "so that is why am sure my routines suffered", "but I do try to keep a consistent morning and evening cleansing routine which I think again I brush my teeth", "and then I usually go ahead and wash my face first thing every morning and the same thing at night", "and then I use a serum and the serum that I have been using lately I there is a few kind of different serums I reach for either a vitamin C serum which I really like because that brightens the skin and that is nice always kind of reach for one of those", "or I will reach for one that has peptides in it like Matrixyl 3000", "there is these different peptides that you can find in serums that are supposed to be anti aging", "and you know help your skin kind of heal itself if you will", "so my friend actually is an aesthetician he is been on my channel before his name is Greg", "he is great", "I love him I used to work with him years ago when I worked in the skincare industry many years", "the I worked in the skincare industry for like four years in my 20s", "it was so fun", "I met so many great people", "anyway he has a serum that he came out with", "and he actually sent it to me and it is amazing", "and I have been loving it", "so that is why have been using everyday", "it is like a wake up serum if I am not mistaken", "I believe it has the peptide that I was discussing earlier in my trixl 3000 and then caffeine", "and then you can kind of feel a little tingle", "so it definitely kind of wakes up your skin", "I always feel like I look pretty tired in the morning", "and then I move on after that", "I know I should be wearing sunscreen", "I am gonna be honest", "I do not wear sunscreen every day just because every single sunscreen I have tried usually makes me break out so unless it is in my CC cream or one of the creams that I am using tinted moisturizer I usually do not wear sunscreen", "so that is why know", "I know I need like a justice or whatever you say when you are like in trouble", "but anyway that is the truth I want to be honest here", "and then I put a little concealer on lately I have not even been using CC cream or any type of tinted

it", "I think I put it in one of my cars or something I do not know", "but I like the lorac one", "as well it does not give my", "it does not make my eyelashes as big as the Laura Mercier one", "so

like hydrating drops", "so I will exfoliate my lips", "and then I will put some of those drops on", "so I have this Tom Ford bronzer that I bought a while back and to be honest", "I have not bought

it when I grocery shop", "so I get it at Trader Joe", "is you need one drop and it is great a lot of serums kind of weigh down your hair or make your hair greasy but for my hair type this one works really well for me", "and so I put it in damp hair", "the next product I have been using is by a brand called color", "Wow", "and it is called dream coat", "this is something you only need to use every two to three shampoos", "and you spray it in your hair", "and it is activated by heat", "but it makes your hair it kind of gives you like a coat like a silky smooth coat", "it makes your hair look gorgeous", "it prevents it is basically like a human anti humidity spray", "and so it is activated by heat", "so I use my Dyson hair blow dryer to blow dry my hair and", "since my ears partially dry it takes like eight to ten minutes max to blow", "dry my hair", "and I just brush my hair", "dry a fun fact", "my friend is", "mom actually owns that company", "and she sent me that color wild

share to it is right for you", "this dry brush I have had for years", "I got it from the body shop", "it is an oldie but a goodie I would say it is medium strength", "so it is not superfine the bristles are a little bit coarse", "you can find a different variation of bristles when it comes to dry brushes", "the other thing that I like to do is smear my body in oil", "as many of you know

routine is a hundred percent green or natural or clean which I know a lot of you think it is I do use products that are not", "but when it comes to my entire body a brand like shea moisture is nice

swiftly moving upwards towards your heart so that is why want to do this on dry skin on your legs on your stomach on your arms", "and it is gonna feel a little bit uncomfortable", "it is not meant to necessarily feel good", "but it is supposed to get your blood flow going and you will feel it so that is why do that before I go in the shower", "and then when I get out of the shower I use oil", "I put the oil all over my body from my neck all the way down to my legs", "and then I try to massage it in as much as possible", "so now I am gonna move on to my nighttime routine and what I typically do at night for my skin", "so that is why am gonna pull my hair back and wash my face with the soy face cleanser", "again get a nice cleanse", "and if I do not fully remove my mascara or you know eyeshadow if I am wearing eye makeup if I do not fully remove it with my cleanser", "then I do use an eye makeup remover and the one that I have been using for years is the Clinique one because it it does not irritate my eyes", "it does not make my eyes burn which many of them do", "and it is just kind of like a one sweep", "and it is completely off", "so that is why have been using that since high school pretty much on and off so one swipe with a cotton ball and then for my skincare routine I have been using retin a I go in and out of using retin", "a", "but when I very first started my channel I talked about retin a a lot", "and I got a lot of comments I still do get comments and messages about retin a people saying what is this stuff", "like it makes my skin peel off", "it makes my skin sensitive", "it makes my skin red a little history on retin a it was originally formulated for people with acne", "and this is something you have to get from a doctor now retinol", "is a lighter version you can get that at the store and that is great too", "but retin a causes your skin to sell or your cells to turnover so your skin to slough off at a rapid pace", "so your skin is gonna slough", "you are gonna have flakes you might be red", "you might be irritated at first all you have to do is either cut back to every other day every third day of course it is prescription", "so that is why want to chat with your doctor about it first but", "over the years they have realized that not is it great for acneic skin", "it is good for anti aging because it does cause new fresh young skin to emerge and for me I tend to do it when my skin is starting to feel dull", "I start to use retin a again", "and my skin has gotten used to it", "so that is why do not get red and irritated as much anymore", "like I once did when I first started if I am still feeling like I need a little something extra I will use the Pacifica day and nighttime cream", "I get that at Whole Foods on my skin after the retin a", "and then if I am feeling in the mood for it you know every once in a while at night I will do like fun random face treatments or all you one of my gadgets after I cleanse my skin", "I might use a mask in this case", "I got a packet of these fun like lip and under eye masks in the mail that is one of the perks of making YouTube videos as sometimes you get to try fun things", "90 of it", "I donate and giveaway", "but some of it I like to keep and some of it", "I really end up liking", "and I share on my channel", "these are so weird looking", "it is like a lip gel mask", "I do not even know if it does anything that crazy and my kids and my husband", "they look at me like I am nuts when I wear these", "but there is two different under eye masks one called perk up and one called downtime the downtime one has chamomile the perk up", "has caffeine so the perk up would be great to use in the morning if I wanted to use it", "but in this case it was nighttime so that is why used the chamomile under eye treatment and then the lip treatment and kind of sat and watched and Netflix with those on for a minute", "so that is my routine again", "when it comes to things like retin a and dry brushing be sure to talk with your doctor about it", "retin", "a is really great for you know", "I use it", "every few years you are not supposed to use it when you are pregnant", "but I use it to kind of basically help with peeling and bringing fresh skin forth and it always works really really great", "and I love it because it just rapidly exfoliates and makes your skin look great so if you are interested in that check with your doctor otherwise you can use retinol which is over the counter that is also really great", "and you want to you are wearing plenty of sunscreen which I am a bad example of but you should use sunscreen when you are using retin a", "but these are kind of my habits and my little tips and tricks for what I am doing for my skin and hair

been a little m i a on this channel lately but", "just with this summer both my boys are home", "so we have been doing a lot of family activities and trying to get out and go places", "and I have not been creating as much content for my channel but school", "starts this week which means I have a little bit more free time to create content", "so be sure to subscribe today", "I am gonna be doing bath time beauty secrets I love bath time", "and I feel like you guys do too", "and these are some easy ingredients that you probably have hanging out in your pantry", "and I know that I love my bath bombs in bubble bath", "but sometimes if you are in a pinch or you want to save a penny you can literally walk in your kitchen and find some great ingredients that are beneficial for your skin and great for bath time with any at home remedies or DIYs", "you always want to keep in mind to just mention it to your doctor if you think that there is a concern if you have sensitive skin eczema or if you have any health concerns you want to always mention it to your doctor before trying any of these ideas", "but my first tip would be to try salts", "my personal favorite is Epsom salt", "but you can use Himalayan pink salt", "this is great for inflammation", "you can use it as a foot soak sore muscles sprains stiff joints stress", "even a sunburn epson salt baths can be very relaxing and soothing and although the benefits of a soak and Epsom salt treated water have not been scientifically proven many people swear by this kind of folk remedy and there is very little downside to using epsom salts and baths so that is why would highly recommend trying it out and seeing if you enjoy it as much as I do the next ingredient that I would recommend that you can also add with Epsom salt or used by itself", "is apple cider vinegar", "now I am gonna make your bath smell maybe not as good as a bubble bath or a bath bomb", "but this can be helpful with relieving sore muscles", "it is believed to be beneficial for body odor for dry skin for acneic skin", "so like acne on your back or any other parts of your body joint pain", "so you can fill a tub of warm not hot water with about one to two cups of raw apple cider vinegar and stir it in the water soaked for 15 to 20 minutes", "the next ingredient is honey now this goes back thousands of years if you remember Cleopatra used to bathe in fragrant milk and honey baths and honey is great for softening the skin and for smooth supple skin", "so all you need is about a quarter of a cup", "you can add it to your bath", "just mix it around in the bath", "and then you can soak for 10 to 15 minutes and you can rinse your body in the shower afterwards if you want", "but you do not have to it", "is totally up to you another ingredient to add that you could mix with honey as well or by itself is oatmeal now", "what I did with my oatmeal is this is ground oats that I would use you know when I cook oatmeal on any day", "but I put it in a food processor so that it is really really fine", "then you can add that that is gonna be easier on your drain rather than putting you know whole oats in your bathtub oatmeal", "is another ingredient to help smooth and soften the skin also really great for irritated skin so to treat a sunburn and again great to add with honey", "another ingredient is oil olive oil is great to add to a bath and with all of these", "you can kind of eyeball", "it personally I do either half a cup to a quarter of a cup just kind of depending on how big your bathtub is oil again", "is another ingredient great for softening and moisturizing the skin and when you get out of the bath you are gonna have a little bit of a film of oil on your skin that you can kind of massage", "and I am all about the oil after bath time", "but it is also great to use during your bath", "another ingredient is tea and you can take a tea bath tea is great for soft shiny hair so if you dunk your hair in the water that is gonna be really great for your hair", "and we have done a few tea rinses on my channel so it is good for the hair and the skin it is great for anti aging", "it promotes healing of the skin it soothes stress skin helps to balance the skin tone", "helps repair sun damage and promotes rejuvenation of your skin helps fight free radicals on the skin surface so tea", "you know we know tea is good to drink internally as well", "it has benefits for your hair", "but it also has believed benefits for your skin as well", "so that is why say it does not hurt to try a bath", "and I usually use between two to four teabags and", "you are gonna notice the color of the water just changes ever so slightly", "but again you can add more or less to your discretion", "the next tip would be to add essential oils and again with any of these you can add essential oils with Epsom salt which I like to do", "my two favorites are black pepper and sweet orange", "and I use these when I take a bath for muscle aches or pain", "but you can honestly add any essential oils that you like because essential oils are great for bath time for the purpose of relaxation and also depending on the essential oil that you choose it may have benefits for your skin as well and your overall health", "so I personally love essential oils I highly recommend doing your own research on essential oils and which ones are beneficial for you and your skin type and for your bath time", "the next ingredient that I am going to share is baking soda which I know may be a little controversial since I know some people are sensitive to baking soda on their skin and they do not like baking soda in their deodorant", "I personally do not have a sensitivity to baking soda so baking soda in a bath", "is really beneficial for itchy skin if you are not sensitive to baking soda", "so this is a great one to add with oatmeal for a chi skin", "and you can add it to your bath in combination with oatmeal", "and it can help reduce itchy skin similar to tea another great thing to add to bath time is various herbs now there is a bunch of different types of herbs such as lavender my personal favorite chamomile", "this is chamomile that I grew in my herb garden", "and I currently do not have any chamomile right now because I harvested it", "I dried it", "and I turned it into tea", "and", "I also use it for bath time", "so I put that in a little tea bag and place it in the bath like you would with any other tea bag chamomile", "is really great for bath time as well really soothing a great bath before bed", "it is also very calming another one that you can mix with other ingredients so a chamomile oatmeal bath", "maybe a chamomile oatmeal honey bath so that you get multiple benefits and again you can customize all of these ingredients or just used one or two of them", "it is totally up to you depending on where you live", "you may not be wanting to take a bath right now", "but hopefully this video will be helpful to you in the coming months and as the weather starts to cool down for a few ideas that you can find in your pantry or your refrigerator for a bath time", "so that is why hope you enjoyed these ideas", "and I will see you guys very soon in my next video", "do not forget to subscribe and thank you so much for watching bye"], "zeVvTF43aFM": ["hey guys welcome back to my channel", "so I like to do a lot of different self care videos on my channel", "and although I think it is important to take care of yourself physically your skin your hair", "I think that there obviously is a deeper form of self care and these are a few little tips that I kind of like to incorporate into my daily life to dig a little deeper with self care and do some self reflection and kind of find that place of peace and Zen in my own life you will often hear that spending time outdoors and in nature is a fast track way to feel more at peace", "and I think that creating an outdoor sanctuary no matter what size or space that you have whether it is a small backyard or even a balcony back when we lived in our apartment", "we had like a little herb garden on our balcony and some nice chairs", "and we would always dust them off and breathe in the fresh air and watch the sunset on our little tiny balcony", "and now we have a bigger space", "and we like to garden", "and you can kind of create a sanctuary with whatever you have whether it is hanging lights or planting your favorite flowers we love jasmine so planting jasmine", "it has a beautiful relaxing scent hanging some wind chimes when creating your outdoor sanctuary you can add whatever you enjoy so", "if wind chimes are not your thing maybe they are too noisy for some people you can maybe hang up a hammock", "I recently found this in the clearance section at Target so just a fun spot to maybe take a little nap if you have the time especially in this summer", "it is nice to have that outdoor sanctuary", "you can also find really great accessories like candles I like to have an outdoor table", "so we could do dinners outside in the summer if you do not have access to your own outdoor space whether that be a backyard or a balcony look into local parks or hiking spots where you can spend time out in nature", "also studies have shown that walking barefoot my my feet", "I do not have the prettiest feet ever but walking barefoot in the grass is really relaxing and peaceful and grounding to connect you with nature", "so that is just one quick tip for maybe if you are feeling overwhelmed or anxious to just get outside and spend time in nature we are bombarded with so many ideas and other people", "is lives and if you are busy there is a lot on your plate so that is why find journaling to be really helpful", "it helps me to simplify not my daily goals but my thoughts", "I will put down different thoughts I try to create realistic goals and plans ones that I feel like I can really achieve", "so that is why do not feel too overwhelmed", "I find that journaling helps me kind of Center my thoughts get clarity on my goals and also know that all the thoughts that are in my head are actually as many as I think and", "putting them on paper helps me see it and", "then another thing that really helps me is quiet time you know for a while when I you know first became a mom", "I was not prioritizing quiet time", "you know I would exercise or do a face treatment before quiet time and something I have been trying to be a lot better at is choosing quiet time first before any of the other things", "and you know it is a little harder to come by because I am a mom of two", "but you know when they take their nap I try to do 15 20 30 minutes of quiet time praying reflecting and just go outside and try to have it be as quiet as possible now that kind of leads me into my next tip because if my kids are interrupting quiet time my dogs surely are but spending time with your pets is a quick way to reduce any anxiety or you know to make you feel more at peace and then caring for animals is such an enjoyable process and sure they have their annoying moments", "but they are so funny and enjoyable", "and it is great for the children as well having pets around I have loved having the dogs for the kids because it is taught my kids to just be thoughtful of the animals and be kind", "and they are so sweet and each and every one of them have a unique personality and give and receive love also my chickens we have been loving on our chicken since they were little babies", "so that is why are super friendly and as you can see they come over and and are very easy to pick up and love on because we have been showing them love all of us since the time that they were babies", "no pets are huge responsibility", "so you never want to go into it hastily", "but if you do not have a pet of your own maybe go spend time with one of your friends dogs or cats or whatever pets you", "you love spending time with them and really showing them love is a great way to feel better if you are in a funk organizing and cleaning is something that I talk about a lot on my channel", "and I think that is because I genuinely enjoy doing that if and when I have the time", "but like I have said before my house is not always organized or clean so if there is a day where I am feeling overwhelmed with so many different tasks I try to do one thing at a time and maybe organize a drawer maybe reorganize a few drawers or maybe go through my closet and purge or maybe rearrange furniture I tried to kind of stick with one room or one area so that I do not feel so overwhelmed", "and you know I have talked about this before my channel but doing regular purging if items like of toys and clothes and things like that if items do not feel like they are being used and they can maybe serve someone else better", "you can donate them", "and so today I am not sure if I am pronouncing her name right", "but I was doing the Marie Kondo", "I was like organizing my one drawer that had gone kind of out of control", "and", "I also want to mention too that I did not do all of these things in this video in one day so sometimes like I have mentioned before you ca not do everything in one day", "and that is okay", "you know so one thing at a time and focusing on one space at a time", "so that is why think on this day", "I was kind of cleaning up my bedroom", "and I just noticed that a few of my drawers had gotten kind of messy", "so that is why decided to clean him out and reorganize and rethink it and one task every single day if you can make that goal to do one or two or three things", "then you know before you know it you will feel like everything is starting to get a little bit more organized and a little bit more under control", "so anytime I am feeling overwhelmed", "I will usually start with one small task and then work from there and do as much as I possibly can in the day I know", "staying hydrated for some people might seem like the easiest thing but for some reason for me it is always a challenge to drink enough water so making sure I stay hydrated and also a rule of mine", "lately I have been trying to stick to water or herbal tea and cut out caffeine which can be hard", "but I was finding that caffeine was making me a little jittery so that is why have been sticking to herbal teas like this one", "this is a healthy skin T that I get at Whole Foods", "I try to go several days where it is water and herbal tea", "no caffeine or alcohol or any other beverages", "sugary", "I mean I do not drink soda", "but you know just keeping it to that", "another thing that I have been trying to do in my life is mindful screen time and this is something that I teach my five year old too you know who likes to watch Netflix and play games on my phone", "it is really easy to open up your phone and go straight to Instagram and sometimes what you see you know affects your mental health", "and you see other people is lives or others somebody else is on vacation or somebody has a beautiful home or whatever it may be", "and you might even look at my social media and think that it can become such a habit to open up your phone and look at Instagram or Facebook", "so that is why have I follow accounts that do inspirational posts and instead of maybe going on to Instagram", "I will go on to an app like this which really focuses on being mindful and calm and relaxing and so anyway that is kind of an app that I will try to go to if I am feeling bored", "and I want to be on my phone but mindful screen time in general and then focusing on spending time on something that you love for me that is music", "I love music", "always have I love to dance I love arts so something that I have been trying to work on is a little bit every day I practice a little bit of scales", "and I have been working on my site reading", "so that is why have been working on classical pieces and", "I do it", "separate hands my right hand and my left hand", "and I find that it is like a puzzle for my brain", "it is like so good for my brain to sight read and work on music", "and it just brings me so much joy and and happiness and", "so those are a few little things that I try to do for myself for self care but on a deeper level than just taking care of your hair or exfoliating your skin or taking a bath things that that bring it to a little bit more of a deeper level and just mindfulness throughout the day", "so that is why hope you enjoyed this video", "and

vision so he started this project", "and we were not originally gonna film it", "and we do not film every single project we do", "but I picked up the camera", "and I thought I would start sharing more small bites of what we are working on more consistently on my channel now I definitely enjoy convenience", "and I give in to convenience a lot", "so that is why still use laundry detergent and cleaning supplies but there are a lot of ways to minimize your laundry routine and keep it really simple and one of those is soap nuts", "and I have talked a lot about DIY laundry ideas and things on my channel", "but I do not think I have ever touched on soap nuts before", "so these are basically nuts they are natural", "I find them from a website called mountain rose herbs Calm", "it is where I get all of my dried herbs and root powders and things that I am not growing you can use these to replace laundry detergent so that is why may not be as convenient to find", "but they are really cool because you need about five or six of them you can put them in a muslin bag", "and then they work for up to five uses in the laundry and you drop it in there", "my laundry is so gross right now and dirty", "I need to clean the washer", "but it works really great", "and they are", "all natural another thing that I like to make is linen spray because you can find linen sprays at the store that if you are going to be using it consistently and it is something that you are kind of faces into they contain a lot of chemicals and of", "you know I am not perfect about using everything chemical free but in the case of linen spray you can make one really easily with essential oils so that is why have some water 25 witch hazel a few drops of my favorite sleep blend", "and then some of the dried lavender from the garden it is a easy linen spray", "so like I said Byron whipped this out really fast", "and it was done within like two hours", "and I had some clothes in the dryer already", "and I pulled him out", "right away they were partially dry", "but I figured I d let them finish drying so I could test this out", "I am spraying a little bit of my linen spray on there", "and it worked great", "and then when it was done that is pretty much what I have been using consistently especially now for sheets and bedding", "I have been using the clothesline", "and then I fixed the bed after that", "and then I usually do another spray of the linen spray on the bed once the bed is fixed and on the pillows and it makes your bed smell nice and lovely", "and you can also spray it on before you go to sleep so anyway", "a quick snippet of something we were up to and a few little tips", "so I hope you enjoyed this video", "and I will see you guys in my next video"], "jqELTO-bwY8": ["hey guys welcome back to my channel today I am sharing with you guys my summer hair routine", "I wanted to try green tea hair rinse", "so that is why actually made it in this video easy to make", "and then we also have some Jasmine in our garden so that is why added that", "and then I found a great hot tool that I have been using lately", "and I wanted to share it with YouTube", "so that is why am gonna go ahead and jump right in coconut oil", "is the best", "it is inexpensive", "it is easy to access I have a jar in my bathroom", "and I have a jar in my kitchen one for you know cooking in the kitchen and one for beauty because you can slather it all over your body", "put it in your hair", "and then I am also going to use a scalp treatment", "this is a from a company called birch", "rose we used to carry it in my shop a little bit of coconut oil", "goes a long way for the hair so you just need about a teaspoon maybe a little bit more depending on how thick your hair is", "and then you can just really warm it between your hands", "it tends to solidify in cooler temperature", "so you warm it up and then that way you do not have little coconut beads in your hair", "and then I evenly dispersed the coconut oil throughout my hair now if I know I have to leave the house I am not gonna put coconut oil in my hair because I do like to choose days when I know it can soak in for a long time", "or I can sleep with it in my hair overnight honestly", "coconut oil alone is really great for the scalp", "as well I usually use a scalp treatment I put one or two drops and", "scalp treatments usually have a some type of stimulating essential oil so like eucalyptus or or peppermint which is believed to stimulate the scalp so I massage my scalp but at the very least it is nice for dry scalp for dandruff", "and so that is why like to give myself a nice massage and then put my hair up in a bun usually and kind of let that sit as long as possible", "okay", "so next we have the Jasmine green tea hair rinse", "a lot of people really believe that this is a hack for reducing hair shedding and also for split ends but it is very very easy to make I am just putting two bags of tea I am brewing up some green tea and if you have jasmine green tea you can use jasmine green tea as well", "because it makes your hair smell divine", "our Jasmine plants are pretty young", "my mom had a big Jasmine bush in her backyard when I was a kid", "and it always reminds me of summer that is like the smell of summer for me and", "so that is why have been planting them everywhere and", "ours are pretty young so what my husband actually told me was that if you snip the flowers at a certain time it makes sure to put energy back to the root so that the plant can go stronger and bigger and every year it will get stronger and bigger and I am very excited so that is why was actually harvesting some of the jasmine flowers", "and I had a basket full of it", "and so I thought that I would put that into the green tea so that it smells extra lovely jasmine flowers are beautiful not only are they pretty to look at but they smell good they are extremely fragile so that is why made sure the green tea was room temperature before I put them in there to kind of infuse for the next two to three hours", "so I kept the coconut oil in my hair for 24 hours", "and then I washed it out with shampoo", "this is the shampoo that I used love beauty and planet", "they have a Jasmine coconut shampoo at Target that I really like I am gonna give myself a nice good shampoo to get all of that coconut oil out by letting it sit for 24 hours", "you are gonna get that hydration in your hair", "it is gonna soak up all that coconut oil and make your hair shiny and healthy and moisturized once I have shampooed I am going to use the hair rinse which is nice and cold at this point and that is also gonna give your hair a nice shine", "so this is the wave styler I wanted to share with you guys that I got I went to Target to pick up some clothes for the boys", "and I went to go get some shampoo and conditioner", "and I saw this wave artist", "it is like maybe thirty dollars", "and I wanted to try it", "I honestly was not sure what I was gonna think about it", "but as you can see this is my natural hair", "so this is how my hair looks when I let it dry naturally which is it", "I mean it is totally fine", "I could walk out the door with it like that if I brush my hair but it is nice too sometimes", "I have inconsistent waves if that makes sense with my hair just because of how it dries naturally", "so I want to try this and", "what I loved about it was that the waves can go up closer to the scalp you can get more consistent waves", "so it is a more polished hairstyle if you will the downside for me when it comes to hot tools", "is of course the fact that they are hot tools they are damaging to the hair they are not ideal long term or to use every single day", "but this is really great for going out and getting that really consistent pretty perfect curl overall", "another option is for me", "I usually will braid my hair maybe two three four braids sometimes and then you can get a fun wave I also picked up a crimper because they had a crimper", "and I am gonna do an ode to 90s hair and makeup video because I have a bunch of fun stuff that I have not had a chance to mess around with and like one day hair dye and glittery eyeshadow and stuff", "that I was like", "where am I ever gonna wear this", "I will do a video", "and I will crimp my hair and", "so I will do that in the next few weeks just because I want to have fun with it", "but this one this wave crimper", "I will probably use more consistently just because it gives really pretty results over the last decade I have definitely experimented with many different hairstyles a few different hair colors and I always come back to kind of what is more natural and my preference is long wavy hair in my natural color", "and I tend to find that for me that is what I feel most comfortable", "and I look back at you know pictures and go", "oh I like that", "so that is what I have been sticking with and", "when I go out my routine is usually either blow dry for straight hair or have wavy hair which either or I like", "but I definitely like wavy hair", "the best", "so this turned out to be a pleasant surprise I have loved how it is made the waves look more consistent and pretty", "and then the coconut oil treatments really make my hair soft and shiny and especially if I am using Hot Tools more consistently or blow drying my hair a lot I will do a coconut oil treatment more consistently", "and if you get your hair colored or anything that could cause damage to your hair so I am gonna pin back my little bangs because they are kind of in an odd spot", "and then I am using my Kiehl", "is musk", "it is a pretty scent that pairs", "well with summer or winter scents so put a little bit of that on my neck", "I am using some mascara", "this is the Laura Mercier mascara that I mentioned in my last video that I love some YSL tinted lip", "balm that I like", "as well it is just ever so

been using it on my lashes", "I have just been using it on my brows", "and so I put a little bit of that everyday", "it is kind of like a gel", "and then I brush my brows", "I have castor oil in my little Beauty cabinet", "but it makes me break out around my eyebrows or I will start getting little breakouts", "oh I have been sticking with this gel", "and then I do not really tweeze my eyebrows very much", "I kind of just let them do their thing lately um so that is pretty much it", "that is my summer haircare routine", "I hope you guys enjoyed this video", "it is pretty simple nothing

elderberry is something we kind of run to every time we start to feel a cold or flu coming on in our home", "and you can find like elderberry gummies and things like that", "but you can make elderberry syrup", "and I am sure a lot of you have probably heard of this recipe", "this was adapted from the recipe that I found in my herbal studies that I am doing", "and so I have some elderberries here", "some water some ginger", "and I am cooking that up and letting that come to a boil and", "we will let that simmer for about 45 minutes there are several different elderberry recipes I am gonna add some cinnamon sticks and also some clove to mine as well which is not in every single recipe that you will find and after 45 minutes", "I am gonna strain it and press it down with a wooden spoon", "get everything out of there and let that cool down for a while until it is about room temperature so about 45 minutes to an hour depending on how long it takes to cool down",

maple syrup or a really nutrient rich molasses or you can make an elderberry tincture for adults but elderberries are high in immune boosting compounds that are great specifically for cold and flu so

to you", "cook them", "you cannot eat them raw now next", "I am making fire cider", "and I have some garlic from the garden", "this is fresh and ready to go this", "is a fire cider shot and you can

garlic from the garden", "I am gonna put three or four cloves in there", "so this is gonna this", "is going to keep everyone away", "I put some horseradish in their grading up some ginger", "gonna put that in there", "as well I am gonna cover that with apple cider vinegar I add cayenne pepper for a little bit of a kick if you do not like spice", "you might want to keep that away", "but that is just gonna kind of warm you up inside and really help fight the cold or flu that you feel coming on", "and then you can add a little honey as well to make it a little bit more palatable and again you can have a little bit of this with water in the morning", "or you can have a nice solid shot of this", "and this does really help kick a cold in the bud for storage", "I am gonna cover this with some wax

Instagram a lot will ask me when I dry them", "do they get bird poop on them or anything like that", "well I tend to grow you know these herbs are outside so sometimes that does happen", "and I tend to pick and compost the herbs that you know that has happened to but most of the time I do not have to worry about that", "and I put that on the rack", "this is on my back porch here", "and I just let

my back porch there", "and it smells really nice", "and once it is ready to go", "I just take it down", "and I can start making my tea starting with chamomile I harvested a little bit", "so that is

overall", "and I have a small little mason jar here", "I am gonna go ahead and put all of the chamomile inside and the flowers will kind of shrivel up a little bit", "and that is completely normal if that is how it looks", "and you can use the entire flower for the tea now for the lemon balm and catnip it gets so dry that you can pretty much rub it through your fingers and", "it essentially becomes tea", "you can essentially choose how fine you want your tea to be if you are gonna put it in tea bags or mason jars", "it is really up to you and your preference so that is why am making three different jars", "we have one for chamomile", "we have one for catnip and one for lemon balm", "and then that just means I can choose to have one or the other on any given day or you can blend them together if you wanted to", "and then I have this little tea strainer we used to sell these in my shop", "and it is a great", "I use it all the time you put a little bit like a little bit of each

first time like a year and a half ago", "and I know for some people it is kind of like taboo in a lot of senses because of this cannabis but CBD specifically has no psychoactive effects", "but it is very very beneficial for inflammation for pain for stress", "my friend has this beautiful company with CBD bath bombs called Kush queen", "she also has bath bombs that are CBD and THC so if THC is legal sometimes small doses of THC with larger doses of CBD", "you still do not have any psychoactive effects", "but it is even more helpful for pain management", "an Epsom salt bath is also great",

or calming book when I am in the bath", "so that is why have been listening to box of butterflies by Roma Downey going back to CBD for pain management", "there are a few that I really like I do not use them at the same time", "but this is a CBD", "this is nano CBD by a company called my hempel", "so a little bit under your tongue", "another brand that I recently found out about when I was in more pain was by a company called sweet Jane and they have pure CBD", "but they also have different ratios with micro doses of THC and what is great about that is because it has significantly more CBD at counter effects", "any negative side effects of THC", "so you do not get any of the psychoactive you do not get a high but the THC activates the CBD so that is why get a little bit more of a boost in terms of pain reduction so recently a doctor tried to recommend pain medicine for me", "and I did not want to take it because the handout was a little scary with the side effects so that is why

of this video laura mercier i have been a fan of them for years", "so huge thanks to them for sponsoring this video and let is go ahead and jump right in one technique I use a lot for my hair is

actually braided my hair in the morning and it did not have a chance to dry completely", "I am gonna spray a little sea salt spray in there that will give it a nice beachy wave if it has the chance to

matter of fact most of the time I am just using some type of moisturizer and then a little bit of tinted moisturizer", "and I love a primer that has dual benefits like skin care benefits and also

brush", "and it rotates the lash for a nice 360 panoramic effect so it really brings the eyes out and gives you that really", "wow", "pop which I love in a mascara", "and it also has gentle hollow fibers", "but there is no smudging or clumping or ending up under your eye", "also there is gloss encapsulated pigments that give a nice intense glossy black color without being too wet", "it

in and fix anything with a little eye makeup", "remover", "maybe any mistakes that I made with my liner", "I am gonna clean up my brows a little bit whether that means tweezing and then using a little bit of clear brow gel to kind of set them for lips i am adding a nude lip liner so it is a few color shades darker than my natural lip color", "and then on most days if I am gonna have my hair and braids", "I am gonna let it dry naturally", "but if I am gonna go out", "I will fix some of the curls maybe so that is why are all going in a direction that looks good", "and then I will come in with

up some heels", "and I had one of those black body suits on and kind of those like khaki pants", "and then at the end of the night it is time to take everything off and", "so that is why am removing

little bit of a pain flare up", "so that is why decided to take a hot bath", "and I like to use Epsom salt and", "then these pain relieving bath bombs that I have spoken before on my channel and some essential oils so that is why like to kind of do", "this blend", "the essential oil blend that I have been using in my baths for pain and kind of overall general health is frankincense sweet orange

creative and productive day and the way that I do this is by a little bit of planning ahead now as a mom", "it is a little bit hard to have a whole day to myself", "I definitely have work days where Byron watches the kids and vice versa", "but today my mom she is a teacher", "she loves spending time with my two boys and also my brother is children and they go over to her house", "and they spend the night at my parents house", "so my mom and dad are great grandparents and so that is why had a full day", "so that is why planned ahead and that meant kind of prepping my space and getting some work done and some creative ideas that I had had on my mind and also studying because I wanted to get a little studying in for this herbal course that I am taking so", "that is why am gonna kind of take you through my day in my creative process and show you kind of how I prep my space so that is where I am gonna start first now I needed to kind of clean up areas of the house", "and I tend to clean in sections anyway", "so since I had a plan to be productive and produce some music and then also work on some studying what I decided to do was clean those areas of the house so when I am focusing on cleaning our bedroom the first thing that I do", "is I strip all the sheets and the bedding", "and I am gonna wash that because there is nothing better than clean sheets and that is you know usually my routine when I am cleaning the bedroom", "anyway I am gonna throw the bedding in the laundry", "and I use this concentrate that I get in my growth box which", "right now I get a box probably", "about every other month this is a glass container and then you need a very tiny bit of the concentrate so it saves a lot on packaging and waste", "and then I am gonna use one of these oxy boost pods", "I also get that in my growth box and that is for just kind of giving a boost to white sheets or white towels and those pods are by seventh generation so that is why am gonna get that started that is gonna take about 45 minutes", "and then I will throw that in the dryer and so that is gonna take a little bit of time in the meantime", "what I like to do is clean off the sides of the bed", "the sides of the beds and like the end tables they end up getting really dusty a bunch of random things", "end up there", "like", "oh I do not know anything from kids cars to wipes Ozzy is collar or", "his tag was there so that is why have to put that back on him so that is why am gonna put all those things where they belong and then have simple like my essential oil spray as my bedtime spray", "and then I picked a vintage flower from the rose garden", "I am gonna put that there that looks a little bit more special and relaxing when you go to sit down and study if I am ever feeling uninspired not creative or do not want to be productive one quick and easy thing I can do", "is clean up the space and add different elements to make it feel more cozy and relaxing of a space so that I am not distracted when I go to do whatever it is that I want to do and be creative", "do not mind my moves", "you can pretty much see my touch the entire time I am filming this video", "I do not know how like every shot", "my tush is right there but", "do not mind that also cleaning up toys like some leftover stuff from Easter", "then I am gonna clean up my Pilates machine because it does get dusty", "I mean the whole house gets dusty", "it is we live on a dirt road", "and there is dust everywhere", "and I think most of the time is dust and clutter that makes any space look you know kind of like messy", "so those are things that right off the bat", "I like to kind of fix", "I am gonna move the dog bed outside and smack that up against a wall to get any dander or anything off of that", "sometimes I clean the outside of that as well", "and then I am gonna mop and sweep the floor or sweep and mop the floor and the dresser same deal move all of the clutter", "I actually move the toys off the floor onto the dresser so that is why should probably put those back into their proper space so moving things back where they belong toys go in the toy box just dusting everything it kind of makes me crazy", "but", "I also have to lower my standards significantly because there is just stuff and dust everywhere at all times", "so that is why usually if I know I want to be creative", "and I have time I try to kind of clean up and make it as organized and peaceful as possible because then I know I will be less distracted this is where I keep my books", "my all the different books that I am studying right now", "and I grew up homeschooled or", "I started homeschool when I was in junior high so that is", "why love self study", "I am this tonal harmony book", "I really love because it

next space that I am gonna be working in today is my music studio which does not get as much traction", "but I will say I do not know why one of my dogs loves to poop in my music studio", "he is I love him", "but he drives me crazy", "it gets dusty so that is why put on some incense my kids", "I do not usually burn incense when my kids are around so since they were gone I burned some incense because it is not necessarily as healthy as", "some of the other options like diffusing essential oils is a lot healthier than burning incense", "but I still like incense", "so I burn it in the studio", "and then I dust everything from my speakers to my computer my piano", "and my keyboard they need to be dusted and cleaned all the time even though I use most of these things daily a consistently throughout the week they still get dusty", "so I like to come in and clean it off", "I bought this piano this past year pre loved from a fellow youtuber named Alex goot", "and I saved up and finally got myself my first acoustic piano", "it was about five years ago", "maybe a little bit more that I bought this keyboard and that was the first instrument that I bought for myself", "and so I feel blessed to have those things", "and I like to take really good care of them so that they last a really long time", "so that is why am going to sweep the floors that is mate", "he is the one who likes to poop in my music room", "and I am gonna vacuum", "and then you could see back there behind all the cords I have instruments for my kids too like children", "is instruments because they like to come in here", "and we like to make music as a family", "and I do not know why this is a stomping ground for my dogs they love to hang out in here", "maybe they just like to listen to the music I do not know", "is it", "my favorite is it ideal", "do I wish they would sleep on the dog beds that I have for them", "yes", "but I try again to not let it get to me", "and I try to remove the dog hair whenever possible because it is kind of gross", "I", "you know I want that to be a place for people to sit and then these mosquito eaters were like up here in that window ceiling window", "I had like leftover Easter stuff on my desk", "I had to kind of declutter in there", "clean up dust", "and then I could you know get to work and be productive", "so now I want to take you through my creative process a little bit", "the music studio or the music room originally was a place for me to practice and create music and write songs and as I have been doing that more I have been getting opportunities to collaborate with other producers and write for other projects and it is been keeping me busy", "and it is cool because I can you know work remotely and then send my files to the different people I am collaborating with so this song may end up being for me", "but it might also be for another project I heard this bassline in my head", "and I have been messing around with sounds on my keyboard to find the right", "so I go through a few different sounds until I find exactly what it is that I am hearing in my head so that slap bass was perfect so now that I know the bass line that I want to use", "and I have the right sound", "I am gonna record my idea", "and then I am gonna start stacking", "I also heard some background vocals and a lead vocal too", "so now I am gonna put that in my wind chimes", "are so loud you can hear them in the music room", "but when you come back to the vocal booth it is pretty much sound proofed", "so that is why usually close the door but to keep light so you can see I am putting down a really quick demo of the background ideas and the lead vocal you wanted to find me to get some clarity to fit into your mold well", "that ai not me", "well look me in the eyes and say that to my face I can do anything I could do anything I could do anything I put my mind to", "so that is essentially a scratch vocal for me to get an idea and continue to build the track around my idea until your mom will adjusting a lot of times", "I will get an idea from a baseline that I hear in my head so that was kind of the example that I showed you", "and I had a vocal that I was hearing as well", "but in most cases I am sitting at my piano jotting down different chord progressions and", "I am actually working on an acoustic album that will hopefully be out in the fall", "and so that is why am currently writing for that right now", "too it is funny because I have been writing pretty much my whole life", "and I used to sit down at my dad", "is piano and write when I was a kid as I have gotten older", "I found that it is not my passion", "but it is definitely very healing and very therapeutic for me so with my acoustic stuff", "I tend to kind of write more serious", "but I love to have fun with pop music as well", "and kind of like express a different side of me", "so that is why am excited to kind of share a variety of different music coming soon and some of the collaborative work I am working on as well", "so by time I was done with that I was back there for a few hours just trying to get through as much as I could in the studio", "and then the bedding was done so that is why decided to fix the bed and get that nice and clean for studying", "and I wanted to try to get a few hours of studying in because again my mom was watching the boys so that is why could try to squeeze in as much productivity and creativity as possible", "I usually have these mesh drapes that are on the bed pulled back so my kids and the dogs do not get tangled in them and", "everything", "but when I am gonna relax or when you know me and Byron want to kind of chill on the bed", "I will bring those out", "it is so beautiful we got that idea when we went on our honeymoon to Bali", "and then I am putting my amethyst mat down", "that is a heating mat I am gonna talk about that more in a video coming next week", "I am making myself a cup of tea and lighting a candle I am gonna turn on the fireplace and kind of set the mood", "so it is a very relaxing space I am gonna put my books down by the mat", "so I have that warm heating mat which feels great the reason I got that initially is because I have been having a lot of I do not know if it is back problems the doctors are still trying to help me figure it out", "but a lot of kind of global uncomfortability and pain over the last year", "and so that is why sit on that", "and the heat definitely feels nice", "and then I am starting the intermediate herbal course for herbal Academy so that is why finished the beginner course", "it was definitely a lot of reading", "but I did all of that online", "and they graciously actually sent me the textbooks to do the intermediate course so that is why can sit and read through the books and also underline anything or highlight", "and it is quite a bit of reading", "so it is probably gonna take me through the summer", "I would imagine to finish this", "and then they gave me some other resources as well like herbal skincare and some herbal first aid recipes", "and I am excited to share some of these on my channel", "like I said next week I am gonna share some recipes that I have been loving", "I also got some additional resources to read such as this adaptogen book these are herbs for strength stamina and stress relief and then backyard medicine as a lot of", "you know I am growing a bunch of herbs to make homemade teas and tinctures and this studying has definitely inspired even more of that", "so that is why had time to really study", "and", "and so it was a very productive day from from my end of it", "and then you know sometimes I will sit down and finish editing as well", "and I", "I filmed this video too", "so it was a very productive day", "I was very happy and", "I loved", "I loved that course it is been so incredible", "so your day may not look anything like mine or", "your passions may not be what my passions are", "but I know that you have a unique passion and unique creativity that you can offer to the world and sometimes it is hard to be creative and productive", "and so these are just a few things that I like to do to just kind of prep the space", "so that is why feel ready to to have a productive day", "so I hope that this video was inspiring in some way I appreciate you guys watching", "and I will see you guys in the next video bye"], "RIB7jpMGGMQ": ["um so that is why are in the garden today", "or I thought I would show you a little tour of what we have been working on the last two years it is been about two years", "I started the garden over there which must show you a few little clips of it I have talked about it on my channel", "she is talked about on a her channel and", "it is kind of kind of a passion project seeing how things grow the different stages growing things from seeds and kind of enjoying the growth process it is been two years of digging holes lots of shoveling the dirt and learning a lot about plants which I love especially coming from a culinary background working in kitchens ordering food from vendors it is cool to see you know how it all happens or at least some of it", "so today I am gonna take you guys on a tour a visual tour", "I guess of what we have growing so far and", "what is coming and our dog is scratching at the door", "so", "I think I will jump right in and show you guys a little visual tour of what we have going on on what if we Talbott farm Pacific time farm whatever we are doing whatever we called this for the time thing is", "this alright let is go when you open the double doors to the music studio you will see some wind chimes and then the herb garden", "last year we planted some white roses behind the studio you can see the pink Himalayan salt lamp there in the vocal booth so that is directly behind there", "and then we also have some gardenias in front of the studio which those have not started to bloom yet", "those usually come a little later in the summer", "and then we also have the herb garden", "these are some beautiful containers that we get at our local nursery you can usually find them at a nursery that carries citrus trees and we have collected them we usually buy them in bulk", "we started growing herbs right here", "we have catnip", "we have some blueberries we have a few berry bushes", "and", "I also want to plant an elderberry bush", "as well the blueberries are almost ready the blackberries not quite", "but you can see they are pretty flowers on the blackberry bush", "we have some lemon balm which I love to use for tea", "it is a natural stress reliever", "and we have some traditional sage we have some time and also marjoram my husband typically uses those for culinary purposes and in different recipes", "and we love to kind of snip those and use those we also have a bunch of different mints we have orange mint chocolate mint and peppermint", "we planted this sage a few years ago", "and it just started to bloom these beautiful purple flowers", "so this is purple sage here", "and then I planted a few new things as well including echinacea it just started to sprout you can see those baby sprouts Clary sage", "I have already started to share in videos", "but I want to continue to share the uses and applications of these herbs and why I chose to plant them and use them we have milk thistle right here", "this popped up recently and this is gonna be a really beautiful flower once it is in full bloom calendula", "is a really beautiful herb as well very anti inflammatory so great for herbal steams for your throat", "if you are feeling sick but also it can be used for diaper rash cream bath soap or herbal infusion next I am going to share with you guys the trees that we have been growing a lot of these trees started out in those wood boxes that I showed you in the herb garden we usually fill those about halfway with soil so that is why are not completely filled to the bottom with soil but in the case of having trees we did fill them all the way", "so it had plenty of room to root these", "are really beautiful citrus blossoms", "so that is why have a few citrus trees including lemon lime grapefruit and blood orange and these have been growing for many years like I said starting first in the boxes we transplanted them into the ground", "we have a peach tree", "right here we have a few pomegranate trees which grow really well in this area", "we have a fig tree and then going up the staircase my husband actually built that staircase from repurposing a gazebo that was on our property he planted a bunch of trees alongside there including pear nectarine some more pomegranates he is got several different trees that he planted and they are all on a drip line irrigation system that he set up", "I will let him share that because that is kind of more of his baby all of these trees are called dwarf trees so that is why get so big we also planted a few avocado trees all of them have had new growth some of them have started to fruit", "but we are still nurturing them and taking good care of them because we know it takes several years to see fruit on some of these too moving to his culinary garden", "I really wanted him to come on here and do the voiceover", "so that is why could speak to this garden because this is his space and what he focuses on and these beds he built", "he uses a soil that he purchased from Home Depot in bulk", "I will try to find the name and share it but for the last year we started a compost and so for the herb garden and other areas of the property we have been using pretty much exclusively our organic compost so in the raised beds we like to call this like our test garden where we can test out growing in smaller batches", "we have strawberries", "right now we have beets we have fennel", "we have some chamomile which actually should technically be in the herb garden", "but it is here in this garden", "the garlic is getting closer so just a few weeks away from being able to pick that we also have some red and green onions we have some cabbage we are really excited to experiment with pickling this year and one thing we want to test out is our own recipe of kimchi you can keep an eye out on both of our channels for the different uses and applications of what we are growing and will be sharing different recipes we are also growing potatoes", "these are still growing so it is funny", "you can kind of dig in there and pull out different size potatoes but", "the green part that grows above the soil is actually poisonous and toxic so this area of the garden is closed off to the animals I think you d have to eat it in very large quantities for it to have a toxic effect but", "even our boys know to kind of run anything by us before they stick it in their mouth", "we have these really beautiful carrots that are growing", "we actually pulled a bunch of these and brought these with us when we went camping and the kids love to literally pull out of the garden and eat", "and then we also have lettuce which we use for all sorts of different salads sandwiches we use this all the time for dinner", "and then we have another bed that we planted some new items in including peppers and chilies so that is why are excited for those to pop up in the front yard we have been landscaping a bit you can see we have a lot of rosemary right in this area", "there were these kind of drier shrubs that lived here when we first moved in my husband took those down and planted some rose bushes white and pink", "rose bushes", "we have some chicken wire around here right now so that the rose bushes can get nice and strong", "we have three puppies all under the age of two", "and they like to run through the and sometimes trample a family member of ours", "her name is Belinda she gave us this rosebush when we first moved in this pretty deep pink", "and then I bought this vintage rosebush", "when we first moved into this house we had a vision of a lot of lavender in our front yard so that is why started with a small patch of English lavender", "it has grown I actually harvested it", "so it is looking a little patchy there", "but we are gonna continue to grow the lavender over the next few years so that there is tons of lavender in the front yard along the fence line we have these white potato flowers", "these are great because over the years they have continued to grow larger and larger and creep along the fence line the hope here", "is that we have more privacy but it is also really beautiful to look at my husband literally never stops", "so that is why is always working on something new", "these wood boxes are going to we", "are gonna transplant our jasmine flowers so that we have a large Bush of jasmine flowers behind the studio in our bedroom there", "that is gonna smell great in the summer we are also planting", "rose", "Byron has been tilling the land we had the soil tested", "everything looks good he set up the drip irrigation and planted seeds just last night actually", "and we have", "I think watermelon summer squash and chilies", "so it is a daily grind lots of love and labour goes into this and a lot of people ask what is your goal what is the plan", "initially we did this you know for us and our family", "but as we continue to be fruitful and there was you know a lot of things growing and as we continued to grow more we eventually want to serve our family and friends and eventually our community if we are able to do that", "so that is why have a lot of goals but for now we are trying to see if we can figure this all out", "and we hope you guys enjoyed this little mini tour", "and we will keep you posted on what is going on on our property", "so thank you so much for watching", "and I will see you guys in the next video"], "zng8q_-hpPs": ["oh my goodness is that a baby it is the baby on the camera", "huh", "so it is been a minute since I have done a sit down chatty video so that is why thought it was time I do not know somewhere along the lines I think I got afraid of talking to the Internet", "but I think some of you might be interested in a little bit of a life update so that is why thought I would do that", "I have a five year old Oliver I have a two year old Isaiah and our Isaiah", "will be 2 in July so in the next few months he will be 2", "did they keep me on my toes", "they are", "they are a handful there are two very active boys", "Oliver was my very easygoing slept very well", "super chill baby Isaiah is a Spitfire he did not sleep very well", "he is got so much energy he never sits still like he wo not sit still or watch a show for longer than 2 5 seconds", "I ca not even get him to watch like Octonauts like any of those Bubble Guppies you name it", "he will not sit down and watch it so that is why keeps me very busy with both my kids I had like some postpartum blues for the first year after having both of them kind of hard to describe because I think overall my attitude was the same I would say for the most part in public", "but I can feel inside", "I feel a little off", "and I just kind of rolled with it a little bit better the second time because I remembered it with Oliver and kind of feeling like tired and exhausted and out of my league and and overwhelmed and kind of all those feelings that a new mom feels", "but then when you have to its accommodating you know the love that you have for your first baby the love that you have for your second baby which it is hard to describe you love your children", "and you just want to show them both how much you love them", "and you want to give them the time", "but you also have to take care of yourself and you also have to take care of your surroundings and like all that was definitely a balance for sure", "and we bought a house", "actually we actually got the keys to the house two weeks before I had Isaiah which that is another story", "and I will get into that in a second when I talk more like home life stuff but", "that is the boys Oliver is gonna be in kindergarten", "Isaiah is gonna do two days of preschool", "so mom will have a little bit more free time but in the day when they are up", "I am pretty much in full time mom mode and then during nap time Isaiah takes two naps and when Oliver is at school I get like a little bit of a window of time to be creative to film a video to get some stuff done", "I have friends that have four five three four or five kids", "and I am like oh my goodness", "you are my hero because I think too is my cutoff like between the three dogs the chickens", "the boys the energy level is very high at all times so speaking of the dogs I see the neighbor dogs are like walking by", "I have got a lot of stuff planned for the summer the boys are both going to be doing swim lessons I want to put Oliver into karate", "and we are gonna do more camping this summer", "and it is fun busy", "but fun I never talked about the process of buying this house and", "how we got here and how that all happened so when we moved from the apartment which I started filming videos when we lived in an apartment we moved to a house that we rented for two years and after we moved into that house about six months after we moved into that house we had been saving and we started looking for homes so we looked for homes for a year and a half", "I was never gonna complain about it online because I felt extremely blessed to be able to buy a home", "but it was a grueling process to find a home lots of rejection we searched within our price range", "we got outbid and all sorts of different things that kind of transpired so the whole process was exhausting especially a year and a half of looking for a house", "and we saw this house on Zillow", "we called our realtor and were like we d love to view that house we came and viewed the house we made an offer that day the offer got accepted", "and we went into escrow", "we ended up getting the house for less than we offered because we had some fluke with the appraisal where the appraisal came in under", "so we ended up getting it for less than we offered and it seemed like everything was falling into place for us to be here", "but this house was by far the biggest house that we had made an offer on the entire year and a half of searching for houses we started looking a little farther and farther outside of the city", "and so that is why can get a little bit more of a bang for your buck", "but we never expected to have you know three acres of land at 3 000 square foot house like that", "was never what we were looking for we would have been happy with a much smaller space", "but it kind of worked out", "we got this within our budget", "and we are like", "well now we have land what are we gonna do with this land and Byron if you follow his channel knowing his kind of history with food he had been growing in our atrium in our rented home", "and I think he looked at this as an opportunity to grow food and instead of like farm to table table to farm to start growing the food that he uses and he has a cool vision with what he is doing which I will let him kind of share that on his channel as he progresses with what he is doing once he puts his mind to something he is really focused and for the last few years he is been utilizing the land and really focusing on not kind of landscaping but growing as much as we possibly can here", "and we have been expanding our herb garden because I really am passionate about focusing on like using the herbs that we grow for around the home and that is kind of something that I have become passionate about as we have started to grow I have loved growing like chamomile", "and and now we started growing calendula and some newer herbs", "so it is such a really lovely experience", "it is definitely a learning experience we have", "we have killed a lot of plants we have learned along the way what works what does not work it is been a work in progress we want to make the best of it as long as we can", "and and hopefully stay here for many years to come and continue to grow on this property and enjoy it", "and I do not think I ever shared the story on on this home and how we got this home", "it is a beautiful space and", "we feel really blessed to be able to have it", "it is a lot of work I will say more work than what I first initially understood", "and I think when we did make an offer on this house that was kind of the one thing we were thinking like what are we getting ourselves into like", "it is within our price range but like the upkeep of this", "is going to be a beast and it has been a little bit of a beast for sure", "but we want to make the best of this space and make it a beautiful awesome space for as long as we are here it is been a beautiful spot to raise our boys fun kind of away from everything but also close enough to be able to get to places if you want to", "I started a business Pacific time I talked about it a little bit on my channel", "but I wanted to be careful not to shove it down your throat while still promoting it", "it was a curated shop we ran into a lot of roadblocks when it came to the shop we wanted to do homemade products at first but", "the insurance policy to sell homemade products was like outrageous I mean anything that we would try to do to kind of start a business it seemed like we ran into every possible roadblock", "and eventually we created a curated shop it was successful for the first like eight months", "and then I started to notice that it was a lot of work", "I mean a lot of businesses do not profit for the first several years", "but we decided to temporarily close down the curation side of it and develop our own products within the brand so that is something we are still kind of working on right now", "the Pacific Time Instagram page is pretty much what is going on on our farm and my husband", "and I now own Pacific time", "and we have some potential opportunities with it", "but it is kind of", "you know I do not know it is interesting because there is been a lot of reward with it a lot of learning", "but there is been some failure with the business as well", "and I will talk more about that in detail as we kind of go along with with that", "but we are still doing YouTube", "we have been doing this full time", "and it is not just YouTube because I think a lot of people get confused on the business side of YouTube since we have been doing this for a while we have a management team they help the flow and keep work coming our way", "and so that is why make a living as content creators and we create content for different brands for different platforms and not YouTube so it might seem confusing because sometimes we do not post on YouTube but", "we are still always content creating nine years ago when I started my youtube channel I was working in the skincare industry which many of you know because I have shared that before when I was younger and I think a long time ago I shared this", "I have shared this before like on Instagram and other place", "but I did a little bit of acting in session work so that is why was a session singer as a little kid", "so that is why would call me for like Disney little Disney projects", "and I would come and sing the kid parts or for Nickelodeon and jelica the lady who did the voice of Angelica", "she did not really know how to sing or how to sing on pitch so that is why had me come in and sing all her parts", "and then she would match me and I would get paid for stuff like that so that is why was able to pay for my first car and pay for part of my college education", "and and that was like a cool opportunity", "so that is why have always been really passionate about music and always felt like that was a part of my calling you know", "one of my first videos I ever put on YouTube was me singing billionaire by Bruno Mars", "and I could not figure out that was my first video I ever put on YouTube", "and I wanted to share more music", "but I could not figure out how to do it on a budget and do my own songs and over the years I kind of started collecting studio gear and slowly created a home studio", "and I have been learning to edit and trying to produce my own songs from my own home studio so that is why do not have to leave", "and I do not have to maybe pursue a music career in the traditional sense necessarily", "but like while I am home with my boys when they go to sleep at night if I have energy which sometimes I do not sometimes they go to sleep", "and I am wiped out", "and I am like I want to watch a show", "but sometimes I will go back there", "I have a vocal booth", "I will you know write a song I will create it", "and I have been putting it out on Spotify", "and I want to be more intentional with what I am doing so that I could start doing smaller shows on the weekends as the boys get a little bit bigger and that is kind of my long term goal is to kind of continue to do that in a way that makes sense for my life and my family while still honoring my passion so like a little bit of youtube working on some Pacific Time stuff on the side and that is kind of growing and building and really trying to focus on music and also just hone my skills and become a decent musician I think I have always kind of looked at my dad and admired the hours of hard work and dedication he put into it", "and now he is on tour with Ringo", "but he struggled for years and years and my parents people always used to think we had money", "but we always struggled because my dad was a legend struggling musician who would be back in his music room practicing for hours and hours and hours", "and I looked up to that type of Drive", "and I think that is where that comes from still to this day", "and so um I try to focus on that one", "I ca not", "the other side of it is the self care side which I pretty much was drawn to work in the beauty industry because at the time Byron and I have been married 12 years he was working as a chef crazy crazy hours", "I went to go get a job because I was doing some session work at that time like I remember when I worked at the beauty store I was called to do a Britney Spears session", "and I sang backgrounds on one of her like bonus tracks for one of her albums and", "it was a song called selfish and when I worked in skincare that was kind of what introduced me to all the crazy gadgets and all the fun treatments and things like that because I was around it", "you know a lot of people will mention to me like you have evolved so much like when you started your channel", "it was all fashion and beauty and at the time that was that was kind of my job", "you know I was living in the city I was working at Sephora", "is", "and Nordstrom is and all the girls who worked there were like dressed to the nines", "cool tattoos heels", "it was the vibe you know", "and that was my job", "so that is why kind of I enjoyed that as well and slowly but surely my life kind of evolved into a more home steady lifestyle", "and I love it because I can still do what I love I can still explore and be creative with my channel", "I still love all those things the core of me is still the same", "but it is a little bit different because my life has evolved and I have kind of evolved with it", "you know which i think is definitely what happens from your 20s to your 30s", "I think you know", "we kind of your life goes and you kind of you kind of follow the", "I do not know the river of life like so cheesy I have created kind of a pattern of what works for making content so it is a little harder for me to sit down and film a face to camera video because of all these issues like lighting and this that and the other I can film in segments with my other videos and then come back when my kids are asleep and do a voiceover", "and it is a little bit easier of a process", "so that is why ended up creating this curated vibe and then Pia seem to respond to that like I think sometimes people do not want to hear me sit and blab for 15 minutes so for the people who enjoy that type of content", "I kind of pumped it out for for a few years", "and I mean it is been a fun process", "but I appreciate you guys along the journey being there with me", "and I thought it was time for me to kind of say hi and do a you know face to camera video because it is been a minute since I have done one you can check out what is happening with Pacific time and kind of the updates on all that on my Pacific time Instagram page of course my personal garden a home life you can you know kind of keep up to date on my personal Instagram page", "my music has been going up on Spotify and iTunes and just kind of what is going on with that I usually share also on Instagram or Facebook", "I know YouTube has kind of changed a little bit", "and I try to kind of stay in my own lane and do the things that inspire me and make me feel creative

department and Isle", "and so I thought I would share with you guys what I got some of the new stuff and then get ready with you today so that is why ran to Target to pick up some shampoo and conditioner", "I got the rose shampoo and conditioner by Pacifica", "and", "I also picked up this love beauty and planet coconut milk and Jasmine which smells amazing so that is why am gonna test those two out for the summer time", "so that is why popped into the shower really quick to shampoo and condition in my hair", "and then I was using some castile soap all over my body I have been keeping it simple in terms of body wash", "then I picked up this dreamy Youth Pacifica lotion and I am also using my rose oil that I use on a regular basis after I get out of the shower I am actually mixing these two together which I will often do especially if I really need the hydration if my skin is feeling really dry which I am outside a lot", "so my feet and my skin they do feel dry", "and I try to focus on moisturizing after every shower and that is something I talk about a lot on my channel", "but I picked up this new lotion by Pacifica", "I also grabbed some of their kind of fun facial treatments the rose and peptide facial mask", "this is a sheet mask I decided to try it out", "so that is why picked this one up", "and I am gonna use that they also had these fun they were more targeted masks if you will for like frown lines or around the mouth", "so I decided to kind of plop those on my face", "and I had a little time to enjoy some extra facial treatments she masks are typically soaked in like a serum type of consistency", "so that is why like to bring that all the way down my neck and put it on my lips", "and then this was the rose stem cell targeted face masks these were cool", "I", "I thought that they were kind of interesting", "I guess if you do not want to use a mask all over your entire face you could target certain areas that are maybe a little bit more dry or areas that you are noticing fine lines and wrinkles so around the frown lines or around the laughs lines but it only came with two so that is why guess you could put one on either side of your your lips for your smile lines or maybe use one at a time and put the other one in the refrigerator", "this was my first time using these so that is why might experiment with these again", "I thought it was kind of funny to do like targeted face masks", "I guess if you will like sheet masks", "this is the first time I ever saw something like that", "plus I thought they were pretty", "and I am kind of a sucker for pretty packaging", "so that is why am gonna go ahead and leave the one on my forehead while I blow dry my hair", "and I got the Pacifica Tahitian gardenia body and hair perfume again", "this was something that I really wanted to test out for the summer months", "my all time favorite scents are Jasmine gardenia and orange blossom which are all things I try to grow in the garden because I love the natural smell but I wanted to try this", "and it smells really nice", "and they do have pretty clean ingredients for Pacifica", "so that is why am spraying that in my hair",

that is why have to be honest", "but I use it very very very consistently", "so that is why know", "I did a review on it", "I still use it all the time because it is the quickest and nicest blow dry especially since I do not have a whole lot of time to get ready on the regular", "I like that I can brush my hair", "dry pretty much", "so that is why will blow dry my hair probably about I do not know 70 of the way", "and then I will start putting on some makeup which on an everyday basis it is pretty minimal", "and I have my makeup routine on my channel", "it feels like thousands of times",

Pacific on ultra CC cream for the last few months", "now I picked this one up at Whole Foods", "I have been combining this with a product by dr Lancer called Danny", "this is a slightly tinted moisturizer with a little bit of shimmer like ever so slight", "so that is why mix the two together because the CC cream is rather matte", "you are not gonna be able to see it is very very subtle", "but if you can see here it is just pretty much the same color as my skin tone", "and I use it the combination simply to kind of brighten", "my skin give my skin a glow and also even out my skin tone", "and then I usually apply it with my hands", "I do not prefer to apply it with a Beauty Blender because I feel like the Beauty Blender kind of absorbs a lot of product", "but I like to use my Beauty Blender to kind of even out all of the CC cream and", "the Danny tinted moisturizer so that is why am gonna go ahead and even that out with the new Beauty Blender", "i got this Beauty Blender", "it is a pink swirl which I think was a collaboration with Erika Jayne", "and I like her", "so that is why thought that that was a fun collaboration", "so I decided to get the swirl one this time using some HD concealer by Makeup Forever", "and then again I am using my Beauty Blender to blend that", "and then I am gonna put my mascara on I", "am gonna use some clear gel on my brows a little bit of tart blush", "and then I like to use a really light lip balm that has a little tint to it maybe a shade or two darker than my natural lip to keep the look very very simple", "why I saw recently sent me a few of these kind of new lip balms they are plumping balms to try out", "and they are really beautiful", "I actually gave a few of them away on my Instagram page", "there was a few colors that I decided to give away rather than keeping but this was one of the colors that I kept", "and I use it a lot", "and it is a nice silky consistency I used to love testing out all the YSL lipsticks when I would be working at Sephora when I was a vendor", "and they always had such pretty silky lipsticks so that one is really pretty", "and I use I will reach for that a lot there is different ones that I like", "but this one was nice because it was enough like a of a tint that that I look for in a lip balm around my face", "I have a few curls and things that I like to come in with my flat iron

has a really nice finish some nail polishes they do not dry very well at all", "but this one does", "so that is why am doing the best I can to paint my nails as quickly as possible and let them dry

herbal beauty treatments I am starting with a very easy cleanser that is oatmeal", "and then I am moving on to a face mask that is just two ingredients", "and then I am going to be making some herbal concoctions or beauty treatments from herbs in my garden", "these are easy recipes and even if you do not grow and dry your own herbs you can find herbs from different stores online which I will share in the description below where I find a lot of my herbs and you can easily make these not do they smell beautiful they work well for your skin and your hair", "so that is why am excited to share these with you", "and I am gonna go ahead and jump right in as I have shared before on my channel we started a culinary herb garden a decade ago when we lived in an apartment", "our desire to grow herbs has grown more and more and I have wanted to try medicinal herbs", "I actually found this a really great class from Herbal Academy", "and if you follow me on Instagram you will have seen that I have been taking this over the last few weeks", "it is six units and it is a lot of reading and you have to take a test after each unit", "but I passed all the tests", "and I got a certificate", "and now I am moving on to the intermediate herbal course which I am really excited about", "it was essentially a textbook of information about the human body and how we respond to our environment and plants and herbs the proper doses for tinctures and teas which herbs are appropriate for children which are not", "I learned a lot and felt like I gained a lot of knowledge on the herbs that I want to grow and start experimenting more with so", "that is why actually planted a lot including echinacea calendula valerian black cohosh and a bunch more that I shared on my Instagram", "so right here I am actually harvesting some of my lavender and rosemary some of these recipes are actually adapted from my studies because they had an entire chapter on beauty treatments using herbs", "but of course they touched on both internal and external use of herbs", "so right here", "I basically have oatmeal and using my mortar and pestle and I am just going to grind that if you want to get the oatmeal really fine you can use a coffee grinder", "and that is nice", "it is a little easier on your sink", "it is a good exfoliant as well", "and you will notice when you add a little water it does kind of foam up a little bit so if you are looking for a natural and easy and inexpensive cleanser reach for this you can keep a little bit next to your sink", "add a little bit of water", "it is a gentle cleanser and", "also a very mild exfoliant", "so I am gonna be making a easy face mask with diatomaceous earth and aloe vera from my garden", "now diatomaceous earth is a unique type of sand that consists of fossilized algae and has tons and tons of uses including making homemade toothpaste with it a DIY deodorant you can use it for", "I mean even you can put it in chicken coops", "there is so many benefits to it", "you can also make a very easy face mask so that is why do highly recommend keeping some diatomaceous earth in your home", "you can find it at local herb stores Beauty Supply stores or even online so that is why picked some fresh aloe from the garden", "I am adding that directly into the diatomaceous earth I am gonna mix that up", "and I am using that as a face mask it is also very healing because of the aloe vera", "so be sure to look for food grade diatomaceous earth when you are shopping for it and research online all the different benefits because there is so many different ways to utilize it", "but today I am using this as a face mask", "my skin felt amazing after and again if you are looking for less expensive more natural approaches to skin care this is a great option because it is just two simple ingredients", "so I am going to sit with this face mask on for a few minutes", "I am actually gonna hop in my sauna which got fixed", "I am so excited it this was a closet for the previous owner", "and I knew when I bought this house that I wanted it to be working we got the heating unit so to prepare I had to sand and wash the entire interior and get it all ready", "and I have been trying to use it as often as possible because there are so many benefits to using a sauna I am sharing more about herbs and beauty treatments", "and I shared a little bit about my sauna on my Pacific time Instagram page", "so I will link both of my Instagram pages below so that you can kind of get tips throughout the week when I am not posting on YouTube next", "I am making a calendula and chamomile body scrub", "this is very healing and gentle to the skin I am starting with some chamomile", "we actually grow chamomile and then you can harvest and dry it", "you can use it for teas or beauty treatments", "I did start growing calendula recently as I mentioned", "but I of course do not have anything quite yet", "and I definitely do not have anything to harvest", "so that is why picked up some organic calendula at a local herb shop called mother nature", "is remedy if I ca not make it down to the valley to get my herbs for mother nature is remedy", "I order them from a place called Mountain Rose herbs I will also share that in the description you can find all sorts of beautiful herbs and seeds on mountain rose herbs so that is why am adding that to some sugar", "and then I am gonna go ahead and add some olive oil and this makes a really simple body scrub again feel free to put this in the coffee grinder if you want it to be smooth", "I prefer a little texture", "but if you are concerned about your drain you can always have it really really smooth by grinding it up in a coffee grinder so that is why am adding the olive oil mixing it together", "and you can use this all over your entire body as a gentle body scrub next I am gonna make an herbal shampoo", "this was an adaptation from my herbal studies and it is a beautiful recipe I was not sure how I would feel about it as a shampoo", "but it is actually really nice", "so that is why would highly recommend trying it", "it is made with calendula", "so I have calendula and some hot water", "I am gonna let that brew as if it were like a tea and calendula is great for hydrating the scalp removing dandruff improving the condition of the scalp overall", "it has a lot of antioxidants", "so it is great for the hair and the scalp overall", "and I am gonna take the leftover calendula after I brew it and strain it", "and I am gonna give that to my chickens because they love it", "and it is really good for them as well", "it will give them a lovely orange color to their yolk and they love it so it is a nice treat for them", "as well", "so then I am gonna come back and finish making with the tea that I made or that I brewed", "I am gonna put that into a container I like to use a glass container whenever I am using herbs or essential oils", "but you want to be careful of course using glass in the shower because if you slip and drop it you do not want to step on glass so that is why am using some castile soap added to the calendula brew I have added a few drops of essential oil to a carrier oil so that is why have coconut oil", "and I am going to add that together", "so the essential oils that I used were lavender", "and", "I also have some peppermint just to kind of stimulate the scalp as well", "and so it is about 2 or 3 drops for both the lavender and the peppermint", "and then of course the carrier oil coconut oil will Harden", "so that is why will see at the top there that it does kind of get that hard oil", "so once you have the steam going in the shower you can put the bottle under the hot water and then use the shampoo if you can handle it", "I always recommend turning your shower to cold right before you get out", "it is a nice burst of energy for the skin and the hair kind of wakes everything up and", "then next I am gonna be making an herbal and essential oil bath salt and these are easy to make I highly recommend taking Epsom salt baths as often as possible", "it is really good for your body if you are feeling sore or achy or you are sick", "it is such a wonderful wonderful thing to do for your body and", "you can find epsom salts pretty much anywhere for just a few dollars so that is why am crushing up some rose and chamomile", "and then I am gonna add that to some Epsom salt", "you can use Himalayan salt but", "Epsom salts are really great for a deep soak when you are not feeling well when you are PMSing after having two kids and carrying them around my body and my lower back", "I get times where my joints do not feel quite right", "and I am feeling sore and achy so that is why love to take an Epsom salt bath I am mixing this together", "and then I am gonna add my essential oil favorites at the moment that I am using for bath time", "again I am gonna add with a carrier oil so with coconut oil right now my favorites before bath time are sweet orange black pepper and frankincense", "mixed together I add a few drops of the essential oils to the coconut oil", "and then I mix that with the bath salts", "and then I put that in a pretty jar this will last for several weeks", "so whatever I plan to take a bath I can add that to the bath and again I highly recommend it very easy to make and", "bath salts can be expensive but you can make them for a fraction of the cost at home after a bath or shower I always slather my body in body oil", "and I have different body oils that I purchase I like to keep the ingredients as clean as possible especially if they are going all over my body but", "you can make a very easy DIY body oil with calendula again you are gonna need dried calendula put that in a jar and then cover it with olive oil and you are gonna let that soak for about 24 to 48 hours calendula oil is fantastic for the skin and also this can be used as a base for many other recipes", "as well a lot of people use calendula and their children because it is very gentle for eczema and it is very healing overall for the body and very easy to make", "so that is why are basically infusing the oil with calendula and you get the many benefits that calendula has on the skin", "so then if you want you can go ahead and basically strain it", "I left the calendula in there", "and I am gonna use a little oil all over my body whenever I can after every shower just because it keeps my skin supple and healthy looking", "and my skin does get dry especially in the summer", "so that is why like to stay hydrated with a body oil", "this one is really easy to make inexpensive and great for the body", "so that is why hope you guys enjoyed these recipes", "and I am excited to share more with you in the future as I continue to grow herbs and thank you so much for watching I will see you guys in the next video bye"], "ctByI3_AAe4": ["hey guys welcome back to my channel today we are chatting skincare", "and we are specifically chatting skincare gadgets and tools", "I recently did a bathroom clean out", "so that is why got rid of a few things", "but these were the ones I kept", "and I am gonna share with you why", "and then I have a few new ones that I got recently off of Amazon that I am just gonna chat with you guys about as well and tell you my thoughts on them", "so let is jump right into chatting skincare gadgets and tools and of course I do not use all of these at once but choose the appropriate ones for whatever type of facial I will be giving myself so starting with cleansing tools I have a few that I have kept and tried to take really good care of over the years I have the Clarisonic profile which is pretty cool because it has a lot of different options it is versatile", "so not can you use the different brush heads that comes with the Clarisonic", "but they have I believe a makeup application brush which I have never tried", "and then they have kind of like a neck lift which I will show later in this video", "so I actually worked for this company about a decade ago right around the time I started working for them", "they were primarily in spas and used for facial treatments and then they slowly started to build their brand and move into Sephora and Nordstrom", "and I was one of the vendors and I would go and educate and also trained at all the various stores", "and I got a chance to try out so many cool skincare gadgets when I had that job I have had the Mia for a few years that is great for traveling", "and so I will throw that in my bag when I travel", "and then this is by PMD", "it is very similar to the 4ao", "it is also", "a cleansing device feels like vibration or oscillation on the skin it is more gentle than the Clarisonic or", "I feel like it is a smoother cleanse", "but I will say if I had to choose one I would probably choose the Clarisonic because you have so many different options with the different brush heads and that is really nice because it is diverse", "and you have so many different choices when it comes to that", "but this is nice as well", "and I like to use that", "so when I am giving myself a facial after I cleanse I usually do some type of steam", "and I have had this for a while", "I got this off of Amazon", "I have used it in several different videos the nice thing about this", "is it gives continuous steam so if you like to give yourself or friends or family facials or maybe you are even running a small business out of your home it is a nice continuous steamer", "now you can always of course do the DIY version with a bowl of boiling hot water some herbs", "but you always want to keep your face above it and try not to let your skin of course hit that hot water now before I use any type of gadget or tool", "I am gonna prep my skin so that is why am going to mist my skin with this", "it is like a dewy mist", "and then I am going to add some facial oil I have been using this calming facial oil", "and it has chamomile in it", "it is really really beautiful", "it smells nice", "and it keeps my skin calm reducing any redness", "so that is why am gonna apply the oil and gently press", "and then once I have had a chance to prep my skin", "I can choose which gadget I want to use and that is going to depend on how my skin is looking and feeling and also what type of facial treatment I want to give myself", "I definitely would not use all of these tools in one day", "so let is say my skin is feeling puffy", "I am gonna choose one of the deep puffing tools one of which is a Jade roller Jade rollers have been around for centuries there is evidence as far back is them in the 17th century in China", "it is very beautiful and if it is real jade it is gonna have a nice heaviness to it", "so it is gonna give not only a beautiful massage to the skin but also if you have kept it in the freezer or the refrigerator or even in a bowl of ice cold water it is going to be very deep puffing so that is why can use the smaller end around your eyes you can use it around your jawline if you have had too much salt or you have not been drinking enough water on days where I am feeling puffy", "I will definitely reach for that", "and it feels amazing", "these are beauty globes", "I actually found these on Amazon these are fantastic for soothing redness sinus relief headaches these are great for deep puffing as well so beauty globes and also serum create a unique combination to reduce puffiness and wrinkles they also feel as good as they look", "it is very relaxing and calming to do this and again", "if you are feeling puffy or you have a sinus headache or it is a really hot day putting these in a bowl of cold ice cold water and using these on your face feels absolutely amazing and the cold also firms the skin as well so overall live ins up the skin and makes you look nice and fresh now with facials you can always layer treatments if you want or keep it really minimal", "so maybe I am feeling puffy", "I will do something to address that first", "but if I want firming and lifting I am gonna reach for a tool that addresses those concerns so this is a gua sha tool", "this is something I got on Amazon", "but you want to be careful always read the reviews whenever you buy skin care tools on Amazon to you are getting what you pay for this", "was not that expensive as with the Jade Roller", "this has been around for centuries", "it is not new although it seems to be a little bit more trendy at the moment", "it is a tradition in Chinese medicine so the skin is pressured and scraped in strokes with basically a round edge instrument that is very very thin and that is what this is", "and it is Jade as well", "and so that is why am very new to this", "I have seen amazing results", "but I also recommend looking at where I looked to kind of learn how to do this properly", "and I will link that below there is a really good tutorial I feel would be very helpful for learning how to use it", "but again I am still learning how to use it properly", "so far I have seen amazing results", "and I did not really spend very much on this at all and when used properly I do feel like the skin looks much firmer and healthier upon finishing this treatment so that is why want to continue using this with different serums and experimenting with it", "the next tool that I got recently is an uplift this one is not by nurse Jamie", "this is basically one that I found on Amazon for about 19", "I was not sure what to expect from this from the price that I paid", "but this also has stones and", "it is a massaging tool basically for the skin", "it is nice", "it is the heaviest out of all the tools so even a little bit heavier than the Jade roller and bigger than what I initially imagined", "but I definitely feel firming in the skin when using this", "I also find that it is one of the more fun tools to use actually", "I do not know why", "but it is fun to kinda", "like walk around the house doing it now", "you can find something like this at the body shop for like 8 which essentially does the same thing", "but it does not have the stones and also like I mentioned", "earlier the Clarisonic has this uplift with this attachment that is firming to the skin as well", "and so sometimes I use that because I happen to have the attachment and it is more like a vibrating massage where the other tool is this this motion", "the stroking motion that produces blood flow in the skin lifts the skin and then last but not least is my LED light mask which is super scary looking LED lights are amazing for healing", "the skin the red light is great for anti aging Green is fantastic for hyperpigmentation and just bringing that to the surface and helping get rid of any hyperpigmentation blue is for acne and then this particular mask has a few other colors as well which have different anti aging benefits", "so I like to apply serums and then use this just basically sit down relax put this on my face and do maybe like a 30 minute session you can research a little bit more about LED and its benefits for the skin", "but it is a different type of light", "so it is actually good for the skin versus some other light that is harmful for the skin so some of these are more recent purchases but some of them I have had for years", "and I love to take good care of them", "and whenever I get a chance to give myself a facial", "I", "I like to use some of these", "so hopefully this video was interesting and I shared with you guys some of the tools that I have and have kept and like and why I like them", "so anyway I will see you guys in the next video thanks so much for watching you"], "qZvGmB9o4SM": ["hey guys welcome back to my channel today", "I had a

chores", "so I decided to make myself a really healthy shake I usually take coffee with me to drop my son off at school", "but I had the celery juice", "and then I decided to do a antioxidant rich smoothie with strawberries bananas Kiwi which has a ton of vitamin C and then chia seeds some almond milk and some ice", "I am just gonna blend that up", "this is great too because the boys love smoothies so it is good with rolled oats this morning", "I also made some rolled oats or you could do soaked oats", "so I was born and raised in Southern California", "and I have lived here my whole

has a really beautiful food channel on YouTube", "and he actually taught me this recipe and this is something he used to make when he worked at a restaurant called into the seventh rate", "and he taught me this recipe years and years ago when he worked at that restaurant and I am starting with my mortar and pestle", "and I am grinding up some cumin which is a really beautiful spice", "I have some avocado oil I am toasting a cumin I have a little onion powder", "and then I am gonna toast the lentils I am going to pour some black lentils on top of that after I have toasted the lentils for about 30 seconds", "I am gonna add my liquid in in this case", "I have water", "but you can use veggie broth or", "if there is a different type of broth you prefer trying to keep it clean", "of course

Internet towards educating", "is is really the future of it because it can be such a like dark place", "the internet", "but you can also learn so much from it", "it is been cool to watch my husband is passion shift a little bit from cooking food and the lifestyle of the kitchen to what it takes to grow food", "and it is definitely been a shift a lifestyle shift for sure", "but something that we feel is grounding and that we enjoy I am adding a little bit of red wine vinegar some more of the avocado oil", "and I also have some fresh cilantro from the garden and some red onions sliced red onions", "and then I am gonna go ahead and pour the beautiful lentils on top", "this is a very flavorful but very clean dish that you can make on a day of detox when you are trying to keep everything really clean and healthy", "we love having chickens and one of the things that we have discovered that is great", "is some of the things that have gone to waste in the past in our life no longer go to waste because the chickens enjoy scraps and anything they do not want goes in the compost but they seem to love leftovers of strawberries bananas apples if my kids do not finish it or there is any little leftover they seem to enjoy it", "and there is such fun creatures to have around because they have such a unique personality so on this day", "I took my salad back", "I was doing a little bit of work I tried to stay off of social media and technology if I am trying to do some type of detox", "but I am trying to drink lots of water", "I had some green kombucha", "and I was editing some

workouts on YouTube and different apps but as of late because I got my reformer", "about over a month ago I have been really focusing on trying to get onto the reformer for fifteen or twenty minutes when I have time", "and I will definitely get a workout in on a day of detox", "this attachment looks like a trampoline it looks easy", "but it gets your heart rate up and its good for engaging your core so that is why do this at the beginning of my workout when it comes to Pilates there is a lot to learn", "and there is a few really great Instagram pages I follow which I can link", "and then also there is some resources that I found for learning different moves", "so that is why have been trying to utilize it as often as possible hop on whenever I get a second", "and I feel sore in my entire body", "you get a full body workout in a quick amount of time", "now it would not be a day of detox without some type of self care so that is why love essential oils", "we have this detox essential oil in my shop that I have been using", "and it is cardamom and geranium", "it is a combination of the two", "and I am gonna put a few drops in the diffuser", "you can buy bundles of eucalyptus at Trader Joe", "is we actually have a very small eucalyptus tree that I collect bundles from if I want to instantly turn my shower into a spa", "I wrap a bundle around the showerhead so that is why make the shower extra hot for a few seconds get it nice and steamy", "and then I very quickly dry brush", "I have mentioned this lots of times but definitely on a day of detox you want to dry brush always going up towards the heart", "but that is gonna get your blood flow going", "and sometimes you know there is different levels of soft and harder bristles when it comes to dry brushes but some people describe it as kind of painful because it is gonna get you gets gonna waken up your skin", "get your blood flowing which is really good on a day of detox", "you are drinking lots of water", "and then I put just a few drops of the detox essential oil on the bottom of the shower floor", "as well I usually put it on the side just to be careful as not to slip", "and then you have an instant spa like shower for me", "a shower is a good time to focus on breath so breathing deep in and then breathing deeply out", "and then you inhale the essential oils and", "it feels like a few minutes of a really luxurious spa when I get out of the shower I always like to put body oil on", "but if it is a day of detox I am gonna use the other side of my dry brush which is a massage tool and this is great for firming the skin also bringing blood flow throughout the entire body", "so you want to go up going in an upward motion same as dry brushing", "and you can use this with a body oil and", "it is just basically a massage tool", "and I did this really consistently when I was pregnant with my boys because everything was stretching from your bum to your boobs to your stomach and even my skin now on my stomach", "is a lot more loose than it was before having kids", "but I still do this technique and on a day where I am trying to treat myself give myself a little self care", "this

herbal course right now", "online will take me several months to finish", "but once I finish I will have a better understanding of how to make teas and dry my herbs and tinctures", "so I want to focus on that because I am growing a lot in my herb garden", "I have some local honey here from a local farmer which is nice to add to tea", "it can be beneficial for allergies during this season especially in the spring pollen and local", "honey can help with that", "but I am gonna have some herbal tea and enjoy that and sip that until dinner I did not share my dinner for this episode but these were

in one day because that is not realistic so today I am focusing on the bathrooms", "so I am starting in our first bathroom", "this is an offshoot of the kitchen", "so it is like a kitchen bathroom",

bathroom there is a lot on the counter I had to clean the walls", "as well there was like toothpaste splats on the walls and on the cupboard doors because this is where my boys come and brush their teeth and sometimes they do not do the most accurate job", "so", "I kind of deep clean all of that again", "the last thing that I do in the bathroom is steam mop the floor which I like my steam mop",

I know nobody is gonna be like licking off the floors of the bathroom", "but it is nice", "and I also kind of clean the edges on the doors there is always a little dirty little boy finger marks on the sides of the door", "so that is why I try to wipe that down as well for the master bathroom", "I have a lot of plants so usually if I am deep cleaning", "I have the kind of hanging plants that I have had over my bathtub for a while", "now I think a little over a year", "and I go in", "and", "I also have a plant in my shower", "I just remove any of the dead leaves and clean those up a bit", "water them", "I also remove anything from the room", "so again hamper rugs all the towels things like that", "and then I sweep the floor so after I sweep the floor I move on to wiping down the tub I usually

do a nice scrub in the shower", "I do not do this super often", "but I try to do it pretty consistently because this shower can get kind of gross if you do not really deep clean it every once in a while so that includes the seat and the walls and the floors and all that we do try to squeegee that is kind of like a little tip that we started doing when we very first got married everywhere", "we lived we would squeegee the doors after taking showers and that helps a little bit when it comes time to actually cleaning the glass part because it does stay nice and clear I am also gonna clean the glass on the sauna door", "now we do have a sauna it currently does not work because it does not have a heating unit the previous owners used it as like a closet I am actually getting ready to get it fixed so that it does work so that is why am I like to clean the door", "but", "I also have to do a very deep cleaning inside the sauna", "I have to re sand", "it I do not know if anybody is even interested in that", "but I might include that in another cleaning video in the future and hopefully we can get the sauna up and running soon because that will be really cool", "and then I like to go through and just organize", "I have all of these random facial gadgets and tools if it is something that I am using consistently", "and I want to keep I organized the cords and get all the drawers organized", "a lot of you may know or may not know that in my 20s one of the jobs I experimented with was working in the skincare industry", "and I worked for Clarisonic as one of their vendors", "so

gonna share with you guys my habits and routine for my skin in the winter months now", "I know we are getting closer to spring but even here in California we have had days that have getting down to the 30s which is unusual for us here", "usually it is pretty warm and we have had a lot of rain and wind and that can wreak havoc on your skin so in the winter months", "I usually change up my skincare to accommodate my skin is needs during that time", "so today I am gonna share with you guys some of the things that I do to keep my skin in tip top shape I d say on average", "I do a face mask maybe once a week sometimes every other week kind of depends on the time that I have but in the winter months I use a hydrating cream mask", "I love experimenting with different skincare and also different face masks", "there is great sheet masks but in the winter months I try to stick with a cream mask which is basically a deeply hydrating almost moisturizer that you keep on your skin for 15 to 20 minutes", "and then you take it off with a towel I love to experiment with bath bombs and bath salts", "but you can keep bath time really simple if you add honey and ground up oatmeal", "so that is why can take oatmeal and put it into a coffee grinder", "mix the two together and add it to a running bath", "this is gonna be really great for your skin", "some products can strip your skin of the moisture and in this case this is gonna help keep your skin moisturize and heal your skin during the winter months I love to try new bath products", "but if you want to keep it simple try that out", "it is really easy and inexpensive another thing that I try to be consistent with is keeping a humidifier on during the winter months they have hot and cold ones", "so that is why can even have it running in the summer", "the only downside about a humidifier is that you have to clean it out every few days I clean mine out with a little bit of vinegar and water", "but you keep that running and that is gonna help your skin overall", "and it is also really great", "if you are a vocalist it is good for your vocal cords you can find scrubs pretty much anywhere and scrubs can run anywhere from affordable to a lot more expensive but you can make it super easy at home if you want to", "and if you are in the mood to make a scrub I am using pink Himalayan salt coconut oil and a few drops of lavender essential oil the lavender oil not smells amazing", "but it is healing to the skin and", "the coconut oil is going to be moisturizing so great to use on rough elbows knees even on the bottom of your feet", "and you can use it on your entire body", "I do try to exfoliate in dry brush throughout the entire year", "and I think in the summer you are more likely to exfoliate because your body is showing", "so you definitely want your skin to look smooth and in the winter when you are more covered up", "you might forget about it", "but it is still important to do it in the winter and especially when your skin is dry and sometimes flaky", "I noticed that if I am not paying as much attention to my skin I can see that it is getting a lot drier looking so dry brushing moving in an upward motion is also going to bring the blood flow in your skin and make your skin look a lot healthier and glowing I like to use a deep hair conditioning mask as well", "so after I shampoo instead of a traditional conditioner I am gonna use a deep conditioning hair mask", "this is a really beautiful one I got in my fabfitfun box", "and it makes my hair soft and moisturized", "I am a huge fan of oils both on my face and my body I am using this one", "it is a calming oil that we carried in the shop", "I think we have a few more of those left", "but I have been using it pretty consistently", "it has chamomile in it", "so it is very calming", "and I have actually been mixing it with a deep moisturizer that I have been using from dr", "Perricone to my skin", "is extra moisturized and if I am starting to feel dry", "I will mix those two together and put those on my skin", "and then as I feel like I do not need it anymore as we get closer to the spring in the summer", "I of course adjust my routine to accommodate what my skin is feeling I also use body oil on my entire body and I switch it up when I was on vacation I was using one by Pacifica", "this is one that we carry in my shop", "this is a rose oil", "it is beautiful because I like dry oils that really absorb in the skin", "and they do not stay slick on your skin for a long time or get on your clothes so this I put all over my body", "and then I put a robe on this", "is actually a relaxation oil so not only does it moisturize your skin", "but it gives you a sense of relaxation", "and so I do that before bed", "and then", "I also like to do hand in foot treatments because my hands and feet get extra dry in the winter months so before bed I put this", "it almost has a consistency of honey", "it is from Burt", "is Bees", "it is really rich and thick", "I put that on my feet", "and then I put some warm thick cozy socks on this", "helps so that I do not get as bad of calluses or dry feet and", "again all of these things can be done in the summer", "but sometimes it is easy to neglect your feet in the winter months because you are maybe hiding them in boots", "but it is still important to pay attention and my hands as well", "get dry", "so if they are feeling dry or cracked I will put a rich hand cream on", "and then I have these lined gloves you can find them at Target you can find them on Amazon", "and they are lined with gel a lot of times the gel is infused with aloe vera or vitamin E", "and you put a rich hand cream on and stick your hands in the gloves", "and I will sit in a robe with my socks and my gloves and watch a show", "and then I will take the gloves off before bed", "but it just allows the hand cream to properly penetrate into the skin and help dry hands feel a little bit more moisturized

maybe done", "but I actually found this fun chicken painting and since I am obsessed with the chickens I have definitely added a little bit of chicken decor throughout the house", "and I thought that this was the perfect fit", "and then I added a sconce and you can put like a tea light candle in the sconce", "it is a pretty small space so that is why think I am finally done with the finishing touches I felt like the wall needed a few extra pieces on there and a sconce is a great option for filling an empty space on a wall along with a cool painting that is a good fit for the room I loved the colors of the painting because it tied in the color of the wall but also brought a pop of color next", "I am making a DIY laundry room sign", "now I have been on the hunt for something cool for a while and have yet to find what I am looking for so that is why had some leftover wood in my garage I decided to just whip up a temporary laundry sign I wanted a sign because my guest bathroom and laundry room were pretty close together a lot of times I will throw loads of laundry in there and close the door when people come over so it is just a nice way to prevent anyone from getting confused and maybe walking in there", "but I had been looking for something to put on the door for a while", "and I decided to make one", "once it dried I sanded it down a little bit but this could work for our kids or baby rooms too if you wanted to put the name of your child", "I mean it is just kind of a quick and easy sign and you could use any type of up cycled wood and", "kind of you know do your own thing be creative with it", "but I went ahead and hung that on the laundry room door I have mentioned before on my channel that when we moved into this home the previous owner left several different boxes there was some leftover wood", "and then we have some leftover wood from previous projects as well that we like to keep an upcycled for other projects", "so I had this storage box that we were not using for anything in particular", "it had a few different slots inside so what I decided to do is just kind of rethink it and upcycle it", "I took out the little slots i sanded it down",

quite a bit and uses the kitchen for both work and cooking for the family", "and he likes to be able to reach the oxo containers really quick and easy", "but we reimagined how we wanted the kitchen to look", "we reorganized where those containers went and we wanted to go for a little bit more of a simplistic homey feel for the kitchen counter", "so this was a really nice finishing touch I actually ended up getting a cool vintage wine rack that", "I also put on the other side of the counter", "but I got it after I filmed this video", "so that is why actually put it to the right of the KitchenAid and that is where that is", "right now we have", "a few copper Bain Murray is for utensils and then a wire basket I got at Target", "and then I have also been collecting other types of baskets for the kitchen also the closet when we moved in this light fixture when I was never a big fan of", "so that is why was on the hunt for a cool light fixture", "I ended up finding one at Lowe", "is that I thought would be a great fit for the closet I have debated adding some type of element to the middle of the closet", "but I do like that there is a little bit of space to walk around so", "for now this is a finishing touch that makes all the difference in the closet so when I finally do a house tour I will show you guys this room it comes off of my bedroom", "and so it is next door to my bedroom", "when we initially bought this house we were not exactly sure what this room would turn into the previous owners it was kind of a little bit like a loft", "but there was very minimal in the room itself", "and it was the rooms painted lime green and it had a few fans", "so I actually temporarily switched out the light fixtures and", "then more recently I added this one which is a chandelier that looks like it has candles I saw", "this light fixture at Lowe is and traditionally this would be more in a dining space", "but I knew it would be such a cool fit for the studio on a dimmer", "the next thing that I wanted to do in this space was add an accent wood wall behind my piano", "my acoustic piano", "any money I had made on the music that I produced I put a portion of an aside to finally be able to buy my own acoustic piano and the one I bought is a Yamaha", "but it is pre loved", "I have to say it is probably one of the best purchases I have ever made in my life because I enjoy it so much I play it every day", "and I always knew I wanted the wall behind the piano to either be a cool accent wall and wood accent wall", "or I was going to decorate it in a unique and interesting way", "so that is why had kind of been mulling on this idea of an accent wall and pricing different options there are some stick on wood options but those are pretty expensive", "if you want to do a wall of this size we had a good amount of gray wood left over from a previous project so that is why bought two additional colors from Lowe", "is so that there is three colors total", "and we cut 32 inch pieces", "and then we did custom cuts because there are some plugins on the wall and also you do the pattern", "and there is gonna be leftover slots where you are gonna have to do custom cuts as well", "pallet wood was definitely the least expensive option when doing a wood accent wall such as this one", "but there were some downsides and possible issues that you could run into when working with pallet wood using up", "cycled what is obviously going to be the most cost effective way to do this project as opposed to buying brand new wood", "but there are many ways to do it lots of fun tutorials and the leftover pieces we measured", "we custom cut so that we could kind of finish the puzzle pieces and finish the wall and the way that we did it in terms of the pattern", "was that we did not have two of the same color next to or on top of each other", "so we did every other color", "and then it turned out to be not a perfect pattern", "but it looked pretty cool", "and we are really happy with it", "we pushed the piano up against the accent wall", "I added a Himalayan pink salt lamp a ton of eucalyptus from the yard the room smelled amazing", "and then I added a crystal", "and", "I also hung up my guitars on either side of the piano which I think really completes the look of this room", "and we are very excited because this room is finally finished it was the perfect finishing touch to add the accent wall", "and we are stoked about it overall", "I think the new light fixture and the accent wall added a lot of character to this room and finished it off pretty much", "so now I can just continue being creative and having fun in the space it is been cool to see it transform because like I said I did not know what this was gonna look like when we first moved in at night", "I come back here", "and I write songs or I play on the piano", "I like to experiment in logic and mess around with producing some of my own songs", "but it is also just a cool hangout spot", "and we come back here and listen to vinyls", "it doubles as my office as well", "so this is where I like to come back and get creative and work", "and my brother actually brought his drum set over as well", "so he will come over and we will jam it out sometimes so overall it is a really fun space and that pretty much completes everything that I have been working on in the home

having a Happy New Year so far", "the last few weeks have been so crazy so that is why apologize that I have not uploaded we had Christmas and family staying with us", "and then my son had his fifth birthday", "so that is why had a dino party I am usually trying to pull it together after the holiday craziness", "so one thing I do love to do is kind of a giant purge organization and it does not all happen in one day", "you will see in this video that I am well I am in sweatpants the whole time", "but it is a few different days", "if you can relate to wanting to do a massive organization after the holidays then hopefully you will enjoy this video so the first thing that I have to do is remove all of the Christmas decorations", "and I see a lot of people keep them up which i think is cool as well but generally after the first week of January I have removed most of the Christmas decorations and the other thing that I am trying to be better at", "is as a family we have accumulated more Christmas decorations every single year", "so that is why have had to add a few organizational bins and also move where the decorations are", "when we lived in our last home we had a few boxes of Christmas decorations", "so that is why were in a hallway closet now that we have some outdoor decor and a few other things that we added to our Christmas collection", "I have to re strategize the organizing and it is moved to the garage which we have been needing to do a garage like a massive garage organizing since we moved in so that is definitely on my to do list", "and I will talk about that a little bit more in this video for now what I am doing is putting them back in their original bins", "and then I bought a few bigger bins for like my mantel decor and outdoor decor and wreaths and things like that", "I want to", "they have a designated bin", "and I also want to label them properly", "so that is why know what is inside even if it is not the label I end up sticking with in the long term", "I want to do something temporary so that when I do get to the garage", "and I finally get that epic project cleaned out", "then I will at least know what is in these boxes so taking down the Christmas decorations and putting them away and the appropriate bins plus the post christmas cleanup of all the presents and what is left over from the tree that is usually the first thing I get done the second thing that I try to do is I write out a list of goals that I want to do in terms of the house and what I am looking to organize or purge", "and I try to go by room by room because I know at this point in my life there is no way I can do everything in one day", "certain spaces are gonna require more of your time and so knowing the places that you want to work on I had put the kids rooms on my list", "I also put closets just making sure clothes fit properly doing the yearly purge my music room studio I had to file some paperwork and organize in there", "so there was a few places and then the garage is gonna be a huge project", "so that is why make a goals list and start going at the different areas whenever I can so the first place I started", "was my kids bedrooms because right before Christmas I do a purge to anticipate that there will be family and friends giving my kids", "presents Oliver also has his birthday", "so that is why got rid of toys that I knew that they did not play with", "I donated", "so dinasaurs was a big thing", "this year birthday party Christmas was all revolved around dinosaurs so that is why got a lot of them and creating a space that is you know basically a place for them to go like a home", "I like this because I feel like it sets the tone that we appreciate and take care of the things that we have if we are not using them", "we donate them", "and if we love them and still want to play with them we take care of them", "so it sets the tone to know where things go and obviously toys end up everywhere all of the time it honestly never stays clean and", "it kind of should not because you hope that the toys are played with and loved", "but it is nice at the end of playing to put everything back before you move on to something else we sing the clean up song and everybody participates and putting the toys back and an easy spot where they know it goes", "and Isaiah I had to purge before Christmas a bunch of things that I honestly I had to go through his entire bedroom and move out all the baby stuff", "and he is moving into like a little man and", "his toys are changing and what he is interested in playing with and", "so that is why has a toy box as well and all his little pretend tools and all of his new Christmas toys", "so that is why also have a toy chest for him", "this toy chest", "I got at HomeGoods", "and I think I bought it before I had Isaiah and when I was kind of getting his room together", "it is just different toys in there", "now it is so cute", "and he knows now too when I ask him to clean up", "or we sing the clean up song he knows to put them back in his toy chest", "so something simple like that is a great way to encourage kids to clean up after they are done playing another goal of mine", "was to tackle all of the closets", "and I got to the boys rooms first", "and I actually did that before we had family come to stay with us for the holidays I just had to go through and look through clothing and certain things that fit my oldest son that will fit my younger son needed to be put in a bin", "and I wanted to save certain clothes and donate others", "and so that is why kind of went through that process with their closets and got their rooms toys and clothes pretty much organized", "and then I wanted to do my husband in my closet for me", "I had several pairs of jeans and pants that just did not fit me anymore", "or they were too tight", "I went up maybe a size or two after having both my kids", "and I do not really ever plan to go back down", "so there was a few that I needed to just donate and get rid of personally go into my closet and kind of reassess and purge and reorganize probably twice a year", "if there is something I see in there that I did not get rid of last time", "but I still have not worn it that is when I will usually donate it", "and then I like to reorganize everything is straight", "and I color coordinate", "and I think it goes back to my very first job I worked at the limited", "and I think I have said this before on my channel", "but my job was to", "the clothes were perfectly organized and folded and so when I do go to clean out my closet after several weeks or months of getting dressed in a hurry and things are not in their spot", "I just want to everything is nice and clean and organized", "and it is pieces that I am wearing and using and they are not sitting there and for my boys you know because they are growing so fast and they cycle through clothes every few months I go through their closets more often", "but it is nice to go through the coat closet and all the different closets maybe twice a year if you can", "so I actually did not get to the entire closet today because I had to go to Lowe", "is to grab something to fix the shelving for my shoes", "but I keep hats jewelry some exercise boxing gloves and some bands purses I have some baskets and drawers for undergarments and swimsuits and things like that", "so that is why am gonna finish that up but definitely the closets in the house is an area that I like to tackle the next", "would be my office studio so that is", "why have a music room slash studio biron actually built me this desk", "it is cool", "it is like it is almost like a draft board desk", "but what ends up happening is Oliver will bring home stuff from preschool and it will stack up on my desk or bills", "will stack up and so that is why usually like to go in there and purge on a more regular basis I put all of his preschool stuff in a binder any bills that need to be paid or paperwork that needs to be filed", "I just try to get that all off the desktop and organized as often as possible otherwise that definitely gets out of control and the goal is a clean desktop for creativity scheduling and also working we started with the tip of the iceberg on the garage a few weekends ago", "and we are basically pulling everything off the shelves into the middle of the garage reorganizing and", "then Reese trad ajay zhing how we organize in there", "so we got started on that we still have to finish that up kind of when we have time", "and we will do several hours at a time", "but those are some of kind of my goals and how I get started with organizing in the new year I do not expect for everything to look perfect all the time because that is not the reality so that is why try to go for each individual area and keep up with it as best as I can without getting overly stressed out that it does not always look or feel perfect so it is tackling one thing at a time

cream which they are pretty similar in terms of what they do for the skin", "but I like a BB cream or a CC cream versus a traditional foundation because they have skincare benefits so a lot of the foundations you will find at the drugstore or at the department store can sometimes be irritating to the skin", "and I often find that BB creams and CC creams add additional benefits to the skin so

little heavier on the eye so when I do my line for eyeliner", "I am never perfect with it", "I do not have the patience or the time honestly to be perfect with it", "so that is why do a line", "and

have experimented with different colors in the past not so much of my channel", "but just when I was experimenting a lot more with makeup back in the day", "and I just never felt like it was particularly flattering although I have seen it on other women and", "it looks absolutely stunning but for me I kind of again apply my eyeshadow sloppy", "so for me the key is to gently blend you do

brows", "I actually cleaned them", "I went and got them done which I have not and forever", "but I got them done maybe a day or two after filming this video", "it does look better to put a highlighter

and continue to blend", "and you know everything is clean", "and it does look a little bit odd when you do your eye makeup before your face makeup", "but I like to do it because if I do get any fallout it is a lot easier to clean up on a daily basis when my makeup is a little bit more simple", "I set my brows with a clear brow gel", "but if I am gonna amp up my eye makeup a little bit more I do like to fill in my brows sometimes to kind of get a nice uniform brow they will be like a tiny little space or you know an area that I could fill in ever so slightly", "i do not do the entire brow

nice kind of like stage makeup if you will", "and so that is why put a little bit underneath my eyes on the sides of my nose if I have a breakout and it brightens that area", "and it stays it has good staying power for a mascara", "today I used Supergirl mascara by it which I loved at first but to be completely honest for some reason the formula got a little clumpy and a little too like slick and shiny for my taste", "so that is why recently moved to a lorac formula which I felt was a little bit more matte and gave me a more fanned out appearance which I do prefer", "so I wanted to be honest about that one and then", "I also I am going to contour a little bit", "I will contour a tiny bit more if I know I am taking pictures", "are gonna be on stage but on an everyday basis I try to keep it pretty simple sides of the nose my cheekbones underneath my chin and where the Sun hits on my forehead and then try to blend it out", "I have had my days where I have not blended it as well as", "I probably should have and it always is slightly embarrassing for blush a classic something that I have loved for years", "is the NARS in the color orgasm", "it is a beautiful blush", "it is great for

be experimenting with making kombucha this is my first time making kombucha", "but I want to share the process with you guys how I go about doing it", "there is an Instagram page that I started following that is so inspiring", "and she has an epic garden", "and she brews her own kombucha", "and I was so inspired to create my own kombucha because honestly I buy kombucha from the store", "and it is not cheap", "so that is why figured if I want to drink it on the regular", "I should probably learn how to make it it is a little intimidating but actually not that challenging once I did a little bit more research and kind of took the time to understand what it really entails to make kombucha ok", "so what we are gonna do first", "is our first fermentation and it is going to be a tea brew", "so for the tea brew I am actually going to be using a combination of jasmine green tea and a breakfast blend", "so we have the nume organic tea you can either use a loose tea", "or you can use bad tea if you want and the ratio is 2 tablespoons to one gallon of water", "so I put 2 tablespoons of the blend in here", "I actually you want to take it out of the bags you can put the bags directly in there", "but I put the loose tea in here", "you can find these on Amazon but we also carry these in my shop Pacific time", "I have organic cane sugar", "you want one cup of cane sugar organic cane sugar preferably two one gallon of liquid", "I know some of you might ask if sugar is necessary sugar", "is necessary because that is what your Scobie which I will talk about in a second your Scobie feeds on and that is how you get the fermentation process going what I did", "was", "I have 62 ounces of water that I have brought to a boil you need a full gallon of water", "so that is why am going to add the rest of the water cold so that it becomes room temperature and that I could put it in my brewing jar so I am gonna put this in here and allow it to start brewing you just want to follow the instructions on your your teabags", "usually says 3 to 5 minutes", "okay", "so that is why am gonna add the sugar", "so you want this to be sweet tea", "it is gonna add a little bit at a time", "so this is what is called the mother", "this is the scoby which Scobie stands for symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast", "so this is what is used", "plus it has a little bit of the starter liquid that is needed to get this fermentation process going so that is", "why absolutely have to have this in order to make kombucha there is various places you can find it", "I am gonna try to have a starter kit in my shop so that it is easy to access", "you can also make your own Scobie", "but I decided to buy my first one", "this is it", "I am gonna open this up and put this in this container", "I also want to mention that I cleaned everything out with vinegar", "so you want to you give everything a nice deep cleaning with vinegar and water because we are from ending years", "so that is why want to", "we are doing everything really clean", "I am gonna put the water in here", "I have another 60 ounces in order to make this a full gallon", "and then I am gonna add this in there", "as well you want to", "it is not too hot when it goes in and not too cold", "so it needs to be about room temperature between 60 to 275 degrees so that you are being really careful with your scobie", "is so that you do not affect it in a negative way", "so that is why am going to have a sweet tea a little bit at a time", "anyone okay", "so my kombucha brew has been brewing for a week and now I am gonna do my second ferment as you can see I have tried to keep the temperature between about at about 75 degrees and the way that I do that", "is if it starts to drop below like 70", "I use this right here", "and I wrap it around to", "it stays at 75 degrees so if it is a little colder where you live you might want to consider getting one of these", "I will put a link", "but I kept it at about 75 degrees which is the optimal", "the best case scenario as you can see the tea has lightened in color which is a good sign", "so the scoby has grown", "and then it is also created a thicker layer right here", "and I am gonna do a second brew once I use this one", "so that is why am gonna pour this and use this", "and then I am gonna do a second ferment", "and I am going to add raspberry lemon and ginger because I kind of want to mimic this", "is my favorite store bought kombucha", "and I am trying to mimic this and get my homemade brew to taste as close to this as possible", "so now I am gonna go ahead and fill these guys up the kombu Chuck gave the kombucha taste it tastes perfect", "so that is why am happy about that", "so I am using a stainless steel funnel you want to use stainless steel or plastic as opposed to metal because it reacts poorly with the kombucha I am gonna fill this one", "up then the third one I am gonna make the puree", "my favorite kombucha has ginger raspberries and a lemon",

the same flavor", "I could have been a lot more creative this time around but", "this is my first time so far the Brut aced good", "so that is why am happy about that I made sure to check for mold", "you can google what mold on kombucha looks like to kind of keep an eye out for what is a healthy Scobie versus a moldy Scobie and keeping it all at the right temperature is also essential to making sure you get a good brew", "this second fermentation process is going to carbonate the beverage which is what makes it taste really good in my opinion because it is like a carbonated fermented tea and it is fermented", "but it is so little alcohol", "it is actually not for the purpose of getting any type of buzz", "but it does have a little tiny bit of alcohol so if you are pregnant or breastfeeding or you are staying away from alcohol you might want to reconsider drinking kombucha or talk to your doctor", "I am gonna add a little bit just to a little bit of the brew and there as well", "okay", "so it has a strainer", "so that is why are good pour so that is why am gonna give it a little rock to kind of mix everything in there", "I sealed it up", "I will put the link for these because you do need a specific type of bottle so that is why am leaving some room because of the carbonation and what you can do is release a little tiny bit of pressure", "so every few days you do not want to completely take off the top but just slightly release a little bit of pressure so that it does not explode on you when you finally open it up", "so you want to let it ferment from my research", "you want to let it do its second ferment for about seven more days", "and then it is ready to be put in the refrigerator", "and you can enjoy it whenever you are ready after that point like it is looking pretty close to my favorite store bought combo", "so that is why am excited bottles that seal gonna go ahead and close that", "so I want to do a continual brew since my first brew was a success", "so this is my first brew in this container and this is a little tricky because you have to pour it or this one you can use the spigot", "so that is why made sure to clean this with vinegar and water of course", "everything is super clean the inside of the spigot you want to you are working with everything very clean because it is fermentation I followed the same rule of thumb when making my sweet tea as I share it in the beginning of this video", "so I made another batch", "and then I am just gonna pour the leftover brew from my original brew in here", "there we go there", "goes let is go", "be okay", "and this is gonna be my continual brew and made sure to move the thermometer", "and then we are just gonna cover no next time next week", "I can make a new batch of kombucha I can just use the spigot", "so these need to be out of direct sunlight but in a semi warm spot", "and again you want to kind of lightly release these not completely because you do not want to lose all of your carbonation but check them every few days", "and they should start to get carbonation in about seven days", "you are gonna put these in the refrigerator", "and then they will be good to serve once they are cooled down", "so that is why am excited", "so now it is carbonated I use the strainer just to prevent from any of the raspberry or fruit bits getting in the actual drink itself", "it tasted so much better than store", "bought", "I was so pleased it was not too vinegary tasting my husband who was not normally a kombucha fan", "liked it and asked for another glass it almost had like a rosy taste to it", "it was so delicious", "I was so pleased and happy with it", "so that is why hope you guys enjoyed this video I will have more information in the description about

the bathroom", "now this is my kids bathroom", "but it also is a guest bathroom when we have family come to visit", "so that is why always start by cleaning the floors and the sinks and the showers

gross", "I have two boys", "so it happens", "it does not always look clean but", "I am gonna clean it before the guests come", "I do try to do a little bit of guest prep when we have family or friends coming to visit", "but you know sometimes the schedule is crazy", "and I do not get a chance to do as much as I would want to you know", "but I do like to add kind of the basics", "so cotton pads ear swabs", "I love these glass bottles", "I get them from Grove", "and then the refillable hand soap", "so basically you get a large refillable", "and you have the glass bottle", "it is gonna save not space", "but you know prevent any waste from buying hand soap over and over again", "you know it can be hard but I am trying to be more mindful of you know", "waste and not as much plastic and things like that", "so I am adding a pomegranate candle", "I also have the matching scent for the hand soap", "and then I always love to have flowers that kind of go with the season", "so I am sticking with autumn because it is Thanksgiving now", "the thing is is we are actually going on a road trip for Thanksgiving but we have someone staying at our house watching our house", "so this works whether you have someone staying at your house as a houseguest and you are there or", "you are not their ID", "you try to have a toiletries basket of some type in the bathroom with a few must haves that my guests may have forgotten so", "this is a new line from Grove called seedling and it is a more sustainable tissue toilet paper it is made from bamboo and sugarcane as opposed to trees", "so I have been using it recently", "I put the tissues you know some body and facial scrubbers some shampoo and conditioner in a basket in the bathroom", "I also added a few other little details to make it feel more like a guest bathroom or like a hotel than a kid", "is bathroom", "and I always try to do this when guests come to stay although I am sure they would not mind a kid", "is bathroom the other thing too", "is that I try to add tons of extra toilet paper in the bathroom because I feel like it can be a little embarrassing to have to ask hey you ran out of toilet paper", "do you have", "more so that is why always try to put extra above the toilet I need extra toilet paper regardless with my kids so that is why try to", "I have plenty of toilet paper above the toilet we have been having family come to visit us even when we lived in a little tiny apartment so the one thing that I always do even if you do not have a guest room I think clean sheets are", "kind of a must have", "so that is why always clean the sheets every time a guest comes and during the holidays I like to add a little something as kind of like a pre holiday gift", "so in this case it is", "you know it is different", "I have done videos in the past where I have snacks and water bottles and a few other ideas", "this time I did some brand new slippers and a robe that I knew would fit the guest and they can take it home and also like a few bedside essentials so that is why know kind of do whatever you feel comfortable with", "but if you know a guest is coming and you happen to be popping in to Target or you know you are shopping online", "you know pick up something", "that you know would be something that they would appreciate I am gonna add some current magazines next to the bed and then also on the nightstand", "I like some fresh flowers maybe some lip balm tissue", "I added in essential oil diffuser", "I am gonna put some lavender essential oil in there", "so the room smells good", "the clicker is right there so that they can watch TV and the room just feels you know fresh and inviting and guest friendly so also with two boys and two dogs", "my carpets do not always smell as good as I would want them to and a trick that I use all of the time", "is I take baking soda", "and I add a few drops of essential oil I am using an essential oil blend called purify", "this is a nice refreshing blend", "but you can use whatever blend you prefer I have used lemon before", "and also I would recommend googling witch essential oils are best to use around pets", "I personally just do not let my dogs in the carpeted rooms they are usually not allowed in the carpeted rooms", "anyway", "but sometimes they go in there", "and you know I have had two puppies", "so that is why have peed in there", "so I try to keep the doors closed and keep them out of there when I do this carpet cleaner", "but it is definitely a lot better than most store bought carpet refreshers or cleaners which have a lot of different chemicals the other thing that I like to do", "is I usually clean the windows", "and then I open up a window to let fresh air through the room", "and I like to do this with all the brooms when I am cleaning especially if it is a nice day so that you know a lot of fresh air is coming through the room and", "then that kind of finishes off the guest bedroom and it is all cleaned and ready to go moving into the kitchen whether I have a house sitting guest or a guest staying with us I tried to refill the dish soap and hand soap that is right there next to the sink", "I have a glass dispenser for dish soap and also one for hand soap so if someone wants to wash dishes by hand or wash their hands there are two different soaps there that are in refillable glass bottle", "so the more festive one is dish soap and the other one is hand soap and then also just refilling the basics like", "there is paper towels around Thanksgiving and Christmas", "I like to add a little bit of color a few little festive details nothing overboard so that is why am just adding some kitchen towels that are a little bit more Thanksgiving festive and just to kind of add that little extra touch we normally have a fruit basket in our kitchen", "I actually recently got this more shallow one I am because with the deeper baskets the fruit kind of gets lost in the bottom", "and they end up going bad", "so this is also a great idea when you have guests put up some fresh fruit", "maybe some bagels some cereal and a container and let them know hey feel free to grab that if you are up before me it can be uncomfortable sometimes if you know they are hungry and you are not going to be making breakfast for everyone", "every single morning it might be uncomfortable for them to ask you know for for breakfast so having things that are easy to access and right there is you know really helpful another thing on my checklist is a coffee station now", "a few years back I did mention this on my channel", "we were having my husband is family stay with us for Christmas", "a coffee station is really nice", "we pretty much have a coffee station are ready every single morning where we get up and make ourself a cup of coffee so that is why kind of clean it up", "I add a few more items so that they do not have to search high and low for sugar and mugs and things like that", "so I just kind of set it all out", "now I want to mention that of course I do try to prepare before we have guests but there have been times like you know", "right after I had my son where I was not pulled together",

things they do not take that much additional time or effort", "and I feel like it", "you know makes a huge difference and it makes a difference so that your guest does not feel like they have to come and ask you where are the mugs where is everything it is kind of right there", "and even if they do know where everything is it is just a little bit more inviting to have a little station kind of ready to go with mugs and sugar", "and and all of that", "I also have to go mugs that we recently got", "so that is nice for you know", "if somebody wants to make a cup of coffee and go these are a few things on my guest prep checklist that I try to do when we have guests and", "I feel like", "even if you can do one thing even if it is the coffee station and a bowl of fruit especially around

prepare for any masks or treatments that you might be doing so today I am actually doing an autumn herbal steam basically you are inhaling the beautiful herbs I am starting with whole cloves whole cardamom", "I have some fresh rosemary that I picked from the garden", "and then you can either use apple peel or orange peel this combination is also nice for simmering on the stove during the fall and winter months it is gonna make your entire house smell amazing but for now I have it in a bowl", "I already have some water that has been heated up", "it is ready to go", "you want boiling hot water", "and then before you do a facial treatment it is a good way to get your at home facial started especially your fall and autumn or winter themed facial treatment or spa day and put your face just above the hot water now if it is burning the inside of your nose", "you are too close you want to pull back a little bit", "you can also put a towel over your head and you can do this right before you do a mask or a scrub or any type of treatment as the seasons transition", "my skin gets dry fall in Southern California means a lot of wind and really dry skin", "so that is why am going to be making a gentle and calming facial scrub and it can double as a mask as well using my mortar and pestle I am going to take some oatmeal and make it really fine obviously", "I kind of I am gonna be using this as a scrub you can also use this as a body scrub if you want", "but you want to try to get as fine as possible", "and I am adding applesauce and honey mixing these together", "and then you can use it as a very gentle scrub in the fall and winter months on your skin or on your body", "and it smells nice", "it is like you know very apple cider smelling", "and also you can leave it on your skin to soften and moisturize your skin", "so it is a good double use treatment during this time of the year I also without my oils and use oils a lot more", "actually use an age defying oil treatment right now", "and I am gonna teach you how to make one if you do not want to have to go and buy one this contains pumpkin seed oil which is really anti inflammatory high in antioxidants it contains vitamin A which stimulates cell turnover", "then I am adding some carrot seed oil and jojoba oil", "I like to collect various oils for the DIY treatments that I make for myself and also share on my channel", "and then I am adding one drop of lavender geranium and frankincense essential oil these are also have many benefits for the skin everywhere from being soothing to healing to anti aging so

usually cleanse I will do a facial steam", "and then I will do a scrub or a mask", "and then I will put my treatment on and that is a stereotypical kind of like at home facial so that is why am gonna apply it the oil which can also go on your body and then next I am gonna make some automat mists fear mist this is great to spray in your bathroom or wherever you want to have your little at home spa treatment", "so for me that would be in the bathroom so that is why have some water in witch hazel in this bottle", "and then I am adding three different essential oils I add between 6 to 12 drops

temperature of 185 degrees so that is why am gonna", "keep checking and once it hits 185 I pull it off", "I am gonna let it cool down a little bit", "obviously you do not want to start to see it completely start to harden", "but you want to let it cool down a little bit before you add the essential oils", "now this is optional I am adding some herbs and mine", "as well they are not as strong as adding a scent", "but if you do not want to add artificial sent to your candles I have seen a lot of recipes use pumpkin pie spice and nutmeg although I did not personally notice that the throw was particularly excellent with real herbs so that is why used essential oils", "I have clothes I have sweet orange", "I have cinnamon leaf and", "I also have vanilla I am adding all of these to the cooldown wax", "so I d say again between 6 to 8 drops of each of them", "you can kind of smell and", "the combination is to your liking so at that point you want to pull the mason jar out of the oven", "you have a nice warm mason jar I am putting the wick in the center of the mason jar and then at that point it is time to start pouring the wax into the mason jar you want to go as quickly as possible", "I had a little tiny bit of a spillage situation", "but I made sure to clean it up ASAP", "but I am gonna pour as quickly as possible", "and then you are gonna want to let that sit for up to a week to ensure that you get a good throw which basically means you can get really nice smell from your candle and with candles", "it is a", "it is kind of an experimental process because sometimes you will have ones that are great", "and sometimes they wo not turn out that great", "or they wo not have a strong throw", "so that is why can experiment and have fun with it now if you do

chores", "so that is why got started by taking a broom and", "and my hands with some gloves and trying to clean out the gutters as best as possible and whatever amount of leaves I could do with the ladder and whatever I felt safe doing", "and then he got on the roof and blew the rest of the leaves which there as you can see were a good amount and the tarp was to collect the leaves so that I can use them for the compost now next year there is a little DIY that I have done some research on that I want to try", "and it is basically adding a PVC pipe a long PVC pipe to the end of the blower and that makes it so that nobody has to get on the roof and that is ideal", "you can obviously hire someone to clean off your roof as well or give your roof a nice cleaning", "but we do this every few months just to the leaves", "do not pile up", "so we are working on a compost this will be used for next year for all of our gardening endeavors", "it is a pretty good size and we add the leaves and also any clippings from around the yard and again at the turn of the season we do a lot of yard work", "and we collect a lot of leaves that are perfect for the compost trimming back flower plants and pruning trees and shrubs near and around the house", "is another thing that we like to do regularly and especially at this time of the year so my husband was doing that he was pruning the trees", "and

as best condition as possible", "but he is really good about doing outdoor work so as you can see he actually did not have as many trimmings to do on this day because he is pretty good about doing it

stoked when they asked me to test out their newest model and be one of the first to reveal it on YouTube", "and then I am also gonna share with you guys a few DIY treatments that you can utilize this fall in winter to keep your hair in tip top shape super easy and effective so that is why am gonna jump right into the video and let is get started", "so I am gonna start this video with the unboxing of the new Dyson airwrap styler so already being a customer of Dyson", "I knew that this was going to be incredibly innovative", "so it actually styles and dries your hair at the same time it is a combination of powerful airflow and controlled heat", "and so it is engineered to actually style damp hair so instead of drying your hair and then styling it", "you can skip a step there are various attachments included to offer versatility when styling your hair there is a round brush attachment for that nice round brush blowout the flat brush attachments and", "then also the curling attachments and they have arrows that let you know", "which direction the air is flowing so which direction your curl will be so", "what you are gonna see here is what they refer to as the co Wanda effect it attracts hair to the barrel using only air", "and then it wraps it for you using only air so that is why do not have to worry about extreme temperatures or using gloves or clamps or anything like that", "it measures and controls the heat to there are never extreme temperatures it does take a second to get used to", "but then once you get the hang of it", "it is super simple and there is no pulling or tugging or sucking in of the hair of any kind which was my initial concern when seeing it there is a dryer attachment most of the attachments your hair needs to be damp and order for it to work", "but if your hair is really wet you can prep your hair by drying it a little bit for me for an everyday routine", "I was the most excited about the brush attachment", "so the paddle brush attachment and then also the round brush attachment in the past when I blow dry my hair and also when I have shared how I do it on my channel", "I usually start with a paddle brush and then my blow dryer", "I aim the nozzle downward so that the hair is always flowing downward", "I love the smooth brush attachment because it is basically mimicking how my stylist blow dries my hair with a paddle brush and a blow dryer propelling the air downward to you", "always get that shiny smooth effect I love a good blow out", "but in the mornings it is crunch time", "and if I am gonna take a shower and blow dry my hair I do not have the same time frame that I used to to get ready with my two kids now especially with the school and getting ready for school and all that", "so that is why loved that in like eight to nine minutes I just can brush my hair dry and get a really nice blowout", "so now the perfect cherry on top is the round brush attachment because once I finish blow drying my hair with the smooth brush I took the round brush and just basically finished off the blow dry", "and I am able to mimic what I get when I go to the salon", "normally I have never been able to hold the hair blow dryer and then work the round brush", "so I have never even tried because I was never able to do it", "but with this it makes it easy have some layers in the front of my hair", "and it just makes those look nice and also it can add volume in the crown and", "it drives my hair impressively fast", "so in ten minutes I feel like I look like I came home from the salon which is a huge plus for mom life", "so that completes the unboxing of the air wrap styler and how I have been using it in my routine next", "I am going to move to some p m hair treatments that are great for the fall and winter months coming up to keep your hair nice and healthy so that is why am gonna start with a DIY invigorating scalp treatment", "it is really easy", "all you need is some olive oil castor oil and a few drops of tea tree oil now tea tree oil is really invigorating to the scalp good for dandruff", "as well castor oil is believed to encourage hair growth and olive oil", "is moisturizing to the scalp as well", "so this is a good scalp treatment for a dry scalp and in the fall and winter months", "you know you want to you are keeping an eye on your scalp making sure it is healthy", "so when I filmed this and put the scout treatment in it had been a few days since I washed my hair and sometimes I take showers in the morning", "and sometimes I take showers at night", "so if I am taking a shower at night I will do like a hair treatment", "or I am not in the morning", "I will usually take a shower if I want to style my hair and get ready to go", "but if I am hanging around the house I will wait to take a shower at night when my kids go to sleep", "and then that is when I can actually do some treatments so that is why put that scalp treatment in my hair you can either sleep with that in or you can wash it out", "I am gonna do a hair conditioning treatment that is DIY", "as well easy", "all you need is melted shea butter some honey and some aloe vera", "you are gonna mix that together and then allow it to harden the cool thing about this", "is it can actually be used as a traditional hair conditioner or", "as a leave in hair conditioner you are just gonna want to use a little bit less also go based on your hair type if your hair is like mine", "and it is fine", "you might want to use a tiny bit of that and keep it more towards the ends and not towards your scalp to prevent from it looking too greasy or oily", "so I am gonna use it as an actual conditioner", "I wash the scalp treatment out of my hair and then use that as a conditioner and wash that out and then finally I am going to make a DIY hair rinse using apple cider vinegar", "so this is an herbal cider hair rinse and this is nice for making your hair look shiny and a nice cleanse to remove any build up especially anything that you might have gotten over the summer with chlorine so half water half apple cider vinegar", "I picked a little sage and rosemary from the garden", "this is optional but I am gonna put that in there and let that soak for 24 hours and then take it out that is gonna give it like a nice scent the apple cider vinegar does not smell too good", "so that is why want to you really rinse it out", "and then I pour that over my hair and then rinse it with cool water and it is a nice again like cleansing cleansing from any buildup", "so anyway", "huge thanks for clicking on this video and watching it big thanks to Dyson for a asking me to be one of the first to try and test out one of their new innovations and then also sponsoring my channel and this video that is a huge honor and hopefully if you guys were clicking on this video specifically to get a look at the brand new product", "you got a well rounded look at it and enough information and then to everybody who is watching my channel thank you so much", "I hope you enjoyed the little tips and tricks", "alright I will see you guys very soon in the next video bye"], "wh_PXRothYU": ["hey guys welcome back to my channel thank you so much for stopping by today", "I am gonna continue my fall series by starting to decorate now", "I am a little bit behind on decorating normally I would start in September", "but I do feel like summer is extending longer and longer these days and the weather is staying warmer and warmer", "and it is not really feeling like fall", "so that is why did not want to start too soon", "I am starting to decorate this week", "and I want to share a few of the things that I started with with you on my channel every year I like to do some type of DIY fall decor on my channel and", "this one is pretty easy to do and it is also a fun one to include kids on Oliver", "was at school when I did this so that is why was not there to help me out with this project", "but normally I would have him help me trace and cut", "and you know help me out with the project", "so that is why have a few more projects I am gonna save and do with him", "but my mom always used to go crazy during the fall months and get us all involved in decorating", "and she is a teacher", "so it was always a really fun time during this time of the year I started by tracing the leaf and then cut out the leaf", "and then I saved the canned pumpkin or the can from the canned pumpkin in my fall recipes video", "I washed that out", "and then I am gonna go ahead and paint this again painting the can", "is another good way to get kids involved", "it is fun so if you want to make this like a family project I am mixing three different colors orange red and a little bit of black to make it a nice maroon color you can of course paint it", "any color you prefer", "also there is a lot of different ways to have fun decorating with these you could even use a a larger can or a bucket or pail of some type and do this you could put several of these along a walkway and put like a fake candle inside so that when people walk up to your door during the fall months it is you know it is like a cool look", "I am just making one of these", "I am gonna go ahead and put this in our guest bathroom", "but again you could go crazy and make several of them once the paint is completely dry it is time to start drilling the holes around the edges of the leaf", "so what I am doing here now is", "I have my drill", "and I have a small drill bit", "and I am gonna put tiny little holes all around the edges of the traced leaf now", "the reason I did not use an actual leaf or a fake leaf directly on the can is because it is a little trickier to put holes into that", "so I traced out a leaf on paper I made sure to tape that onto the can", "and then this is the most", "you know this is the hardest part of the project which is going around the edges to create little tiny holes all around the edges at this point I needed to do a few paint touch ups just to", "it was nice and clean", "and then I put a tea light in there", "and then the light shines through I", "just put this in my guest bathroom with a few other little decor pieces and then my favorite hand soap that I found from Trader Joe is it is their apple cider hand soap", "but how pretty would one of these be or several of these be outside along a pathway or", "if you did a larger version of these I would personally put a fake tea light in there because you get the same effect and you do not have to worry about it", "it is a pretty like candle holder or tea light holder", "and so that was the first one that I made relatively easy", "and you know a fun one to include the kids on as well", "and then the other thing that I wanted to make was scented pine cones I gave my son and his cousin is the job of going and finding me some pine cones from around the yard", "I washed them", "and then I put them in the oven at 250 degrees to dry them great thing about these", "is it is not for fall", "it is great for wintertime and Christmas time", "and then once I pulled those out of the oven", "I am gonna put some cinnamon essential oil drops on each of the pine cones", "so I d say three to five drops on each of them", "keep in mind when you are using cinnamon essential oil to wash your hands after because if you touch your eyes with cinnamon essential oil it is going to burn I am sure most people already know that", "but that is something to keep in mind especially around pets and children", "it is a very strong essential oil so after a few drops on each of the pine cones", "I am just gonna put that in a large glass container and this is nice to put in a bathroom as well because it just releases a beautiful scent into the air and instead of having to buy these they are easy to make", "so I made some scented pine cones I put that on my fireplace with a fairy tale pumpkin once I start using the fireplace I will probably move it into one of the bathrooms", "and then I started to decorate the mantel", "so normally I will do the front door or I will decorate other areas of the house", "but this year I started with a mantel", "and I got this wreath on sale at Hobby Lobby", "but I felt like it was", "it was definitely in the fall section", "but I felt like it could go as a Christmas wreath", "it is pretty neutral so that is why wanted to add to it", "so that is why took some elements from the yard I feel like I use eucalyptus for everything", "but it is because I have it in my yard", "so it is just easy to go to", "I decided to put that all around the wreath to add some color", "you", "I also added some of these white pumpkins that I got at Hobby Lobby and inserted that into the wreath as well", "so what I like about this wreath is that I could have added colorful leaves onto it", "you can customize it in any way that you wanted", "but I wanted to make it a temporary customization so that I could also do that for winter", "so I did not want to glue anything if you needed you could use a little twine to tie everything in there but", "by inserting everything stayed and then the eucalyptus was kind of like falling out", "so I wanted to I went in and kind of tucked it", "and this wo not last very long obviously because the eucalyptus will dry out so it is temporary", "and", "but", "I also added some eucalyptus and pine cones to the mantle itself now after this dries out I will take it away and the mantle will be a little bit more bare and some people prefer that anyway because depending on the proximity of your mantle to your fireplace it could be a fire hazard to have foliage once we are starting to use the fireplace more consistently", "I do keep that in mind", "but it is a beautiful look", "you see it a lot in magazines around Pinterest and this year I wanted to experiment with a more muted mantel decor and so that is why went with white pumpkins and our rustic pumpkins that we have", "and we use year after year", "and we decorate with them a little bit differently also", "those faux birch candles and the candle holders I use those season after season to decorate because they are neutral and they work with everything", "so I added a few other elements the pumpkins that we plan to carve and that kind of finishes off the fireplace", "and now I have to move to the other areas of the house also if I start decorating early enough", "sometimes I will switch it out so that is why actually have a secondary wreath I can either use on the door", "or here I got that from Kohl", "is along with the letter board they were having a sale there", "and then I will either decide to have foliage or no foliage at all and keep it a little bit more simple", "so I like to experiment", "and then if I am not liking something I will switch it out or if the foliage dies I will adjust it", "and so I think I am actually going to stick with this one for the mantel for the rest of the season hopefully you guys enjoyed this video", "and I do have a variety of fall videos coming soon from more recipes to some of the routines that we like to do as a family to some beauty spa goodness", "so I am gonna hit all of that on my channel this fall season", "so keep your eyes peeled thank you so much for watching", "and I will see you in the next video bye"], "Xc_z-7v_vAo":

there", "and I shared about the chickens and a lot of you guys", "were asking what our setup is what made us decide to get chickens what did we get chickens for", "I thought I would do a quick video just answering questions and sharing our setup with you I researched a little bit on the places where I could go to get baby chicks different feed stores have them at different times of the year tractor supply is a store nearest that has them at different times of the year there is different hatcheries but my neighbor actually raises chickens and she told me about my pet chicken calm where you can get all sorts of different types of breeds the time in which they are available it varies", "but they also have not a great selection of chickens", "but they also have a really great selection of items you will need to care for your chickens", "and then they had a informative blog", "and I read all of their blog posts about raising chickens and how to prepare and what you need to know and how to care for them also not sponsored at all by the way", "but they had a live chat", "so you could ask all of these different questions and it was a good experience", "um I got my chickens and they were healthy several months before we knew we were actually gonna get chickens I started following different hashtags on Instagram", "I followed the hashtag raising chickens I figured out which breeds I was interested in based on what color eggs we wanted and then also personality types I tried to familiarize myself with the different breeds by following those hashtags so like white Cochin and Easter Eggers", "and then I would communicate with the different people on Instagram and ask them questions once I knew which breeds I wanted", "and I had ordered them", "and I knew when they were gonna hatch and", "when they were gonna arrive it was time for me to get set up now", "like I said they had a lot of the items I would have needed on the website", "but I went ahead to my local tractor supply tractor supply", "actually has chicks during certain times of the year", "they do not have them right now", "but they do have everything I needed to prepare for them such as the chick starter and grower which is their food and also the containers that I put their food and water in now", "I have never raised two chicks before but based on my research there are cell feeders", "so you put out fresh water for them daily and also have fresh food", "but they will eat when they are hungry and drink when they are thirsty", "so it is not like a dog or a cat when you want to put it out at certain times because they might overeat", "I also got some probiotics and electrolytes to add to their water", "I just followed the instructions on the back of this", "but it was also recommended just because it can be a little stressful when they are sent to you as opposed to you know taking them from a hatchery it is a little stressful on their stomachs and on their you know on their systems", "so that is why want to", "they are healthy we are raising these to be our pets", "but we are also raising them to hopefully produce organic eggs and", "these are all supposed to be females", "and I made sure to specify that when I ordered them from the website but you never know there may be a rooster in there", "so that is why will have to wait and see because there is a 90 chance that they are female but", "always a 10 chance that there could be a rooster in there", "so now I wanted to", "I got everything for the brooder which is where they live until they are big

I ended up going with that", "is a white poaching and that that lays brown eggs I am the one that leaves green I will be sharing more of our raising chicken adventures here on YouTube", "but I also post pretty much daily on my Instagram our family everything we have going on with our pets and around the house", "and it is a little bit more behind the scenes as well", "also we have had a few

chopped up a pumpkin pie pumpkin some carrots and squash I am gonna go ahead and put that in there and cook that very lightly I am gonna add some spices some salt and pepper", "and then I am gonna add some veggie stock and basically let that cook until everything is really softened at the end here I like to put in some chopped apple that gives it a really nice flavor", "and I put that in in the end

now before I start to decorate for fall there are a few things that need to be checked now", "it is still as you can see 80 degrees in California", "but if you just turn on the heater on a day when it is a little cold you can get a sense if you have not used it since the last winter if it needs you know you need to call someone out to check on it", "run it for a little bit", "it is running smoothly and", "then also the fireplace you may need to call someone to clean it or inspect it we had ours inspected recently", "and I do clean it at the end of winter when we are finished using the fireplace", "and then I like to clean it again before because sometimes you know we will have a cold day and sometimes we will start a fire as you can see it does need a little bit of cleaning", "but it is not as messy as it is at the end of winter when it needs a nice good clean", "now it is supposed to rain and get a little colder here this week", "so I decided to clean it and get it prepped for

sucks up literally everything and one of the best vacuums I have ever owned in terms of that", "so I do love it", "I use the little attachment to make sure to get all of the extra ash or leftover wood", "and then you will want to clean out your vacuum as well so that it does not smell like fireplace", "and then I am gonna give the inside of the fireplace a good scrub", "now again we are probably not going to be using it for at least a few days", "so that is why can use a little baking soda", "some dish soap mix that together and use a scrubber and just kind of scrub the inside of the fireplace", "now I am not gonna go too crazy because obviously this is a fireplace and it is gonna get dirty again", "but this does help cut the smell a little bit and this is something I like to do twice a year to get it nice and clean", "now I like to do a deep cleaning twice a year", "but once we do start using the fireplace I have to clean it regularly to the entire house does not smell like a giant fireplace so removing any extra ash and wood and things like that", "so", "but a good nice scrub is a good prep to get it ready to go and a lot of times you will want to call someone out just to inspect it", "or sometimes you can even call someone out to give it a nice good cleaning if it is been awhile when we first got this home", "this fireplace actually did not work so that is why had to invest a good amount to get it up and running again and inspected and all ready to go", "so that is why have had it inspected recently", "and I like to try to maintain it by keeping it clean", "and

is appropriate for a fire now around the turn of the season I do like to do window and lighting maintenance", "so that is why do try to even though on a regular basis I like to dust and clean the windows and the lights and all that light fixtures I definitely like to touch on that at the turn of the season", "so before fall in winter I like to", "I am touching all of the light fixtures dusting them I am replacing any bulbs that need to be replaced", "and then I am giving my windows a nice good clean several videos back", "I shared my routine on how I clean the windows before the weather cools down", "you also want to that the windows are opening and closing properly there is no drafts being let in", "and I also like to give the windows a really good clean", "so this is actually what I showed in the video before some baking soda and vinegar in that area of the window that definitely collects dust and gets kind of gross and then a toothbrush you can get that nice and clean and then come in with a towel", "get that nice and clean and then also use some wd 40 to again all the windows are opening and closing properly and cleaning the windows themselves and that is definitely something I like to try to do when I do money spring cleaning when I do my fall and winter cleaning moving into the kitchen a lot of times when I am cleaning out my refrigerator", "I am doing a surface cleaning something had spilled in my refrigerator and it was looking pretty gross so that is why definitely needed to do this anyway", "but at the turn of the season I like to pull everything out and clean it with soap and water and basically get it extremely clean and ready to go for the next season so once", "a week when I am getting the groceries I will do you know a surface clean", "I will wipe down the refrigerator and it is all clean", "but I do not necessarily pull out all the attachments", "and so it was time to do it", "so that is why am gonna do that here and get it all ready to go so in my previous decluttering video", "I shared how I was cleaning out the kitchen cabinets and getting rid of anything that you know I no longer use or has broken or has cracks or anything so that is something I would recommend doing also at the turn of the season cleaning out the oven", "is another really good one same type of thing dish soap and baking soda", "pretty much cleans everything", "and then a good scrub brush", "and I am gonna give it a really good clean and pull everything out and clean the oven", "get it nice and sparkly", "and hopefully we will be using the oven even more in the fall in winter months", "so it is always good to give it a nice good scrub again something I try to do more often", "you know every few weeks maybe not once a week but moving the carpet back", "this carpet looks pretty", "I got it on Amazon", "I like it because it is pretty", "but my dogs think it is where they are supposed to go to the bathroom sometimes not all the time",

has a ridiculous amount of dust", "so it is pretty", "but it is definitely high maintenance", "also this happens every few weeks but at the turn of the season definitely pushing back all of the furniture there is always a good amount of dust bunnies and random toys and lost remotes and hair ties things that you do not know where they are", "they are probably behind the couch", "so I like to clean all that up", "i vacuumed", "I also vacuumed the edges I vacuum the back of the couch", "I have a special attachment for my vacuum that is for furniture", "I also have pets that have fur", "so that is why try to get it as clean as possible and basically looking how I would want it to look if there was no furniture there because things just tend to collect and Cheerios and dust bunnies and

touches", "so when our family comes to visit in October it is feeling a little bit more finished and less barren than it was before there is a few more things that I want to do in this room", "I will

different color than the rest of the house", "it is got like a funky sink", "so I kind of play off of that", "I put my favorite soap from Trader Joe", "is this is the French liquid it is orange blossom soap", "it smells amazing and", "then a plant again plants always add life it is a small plant", "so it is not gonna crowd this room too much", "it is a very small bathroom", "so that is why

have a double mattress", "so that is why have our mattress here which is a natural mattress I got from my green mattress", "and then I have kind of like a box that lifts it up", "so the bed is much

believe that it can help with kidney stones and detoxifying the body and balancing the pH", "but that is personally", "what I use it for thyme is another beautiful herb and you can make a fantastic

purge", "my pantry now ideally I would not be buying any food that is not consumed and you are wasting as little food as possible but", "the reality is sometimes you have food in your pantry that is

ton of coverage one thing I noticed after my kids is I do have a little bit of shadowing right here above my lip", "it is nothing that is a big deal", "but it is nice to have something that kind of

whole time I am talking", "you can tell me these things", "it is okay", "I d", "rather you tell me than me sit there looking like pathetic with all this mascara under my eyes", "so one thing I like about this is this does not it does not end up into my eyes so that is why am really happy about that", "and then if you work it in it actually gives some nice volumes", "so that is", "why have actually been", "I usually do not", "and I even said in the video first time I filmed it I do not usually like this type of wand", "I have been happy with this little makeup routine I have switched to

kids and what I use to feed them", "it kind of depends", "I get those suction trays for Isaiah any plate or anything he will pick up and throw so reusable Ziploc bags I get those from Grove", "and then I have the divided containers for lunches because my eldest is in school so that is why like those in terms of how I pack lunches and how I feed my toddler mornings can be kind of crazy and on the weekends we do like to do like homemade pancakes or a special breakfast", "but I like Earth is best pancakes or like mini pancakes and Trader Joe", "is waffles", "and I like to rotate between oatmeal waffles and pancakes", "and then I add some type of fruit with that and that seems to be a really good rotation in terms of breakfast because my kids like the waffles and the pancakes", "and

it is simple and", "my kids love it so", "for lunch time it varies if my son is in school which he goes three days", "a week I will make him a lunch", "or he has hot lunch", "sometimes I usually kind of surprise him with hot lunch so to kind of make the traditional peanut butter and jelly that kids love and is easy for parents to kind of change it up and make it a little bit more exciting I flatten the bread a little tiny bit so the sandwich itself is a little flatter", "and then you can roll it and cut it", "and then you have little peanut butter and jelly rolls instead of", "a sandwich", "it is just a little change to you know something that I feel like as parents we all make a lot for our kids because it is easy", "and it is good and heck", "sometimes I even have peanut butter and jelly for lunch", "so that is why get my whole grain bread from Trader Joe is and", "their peanut butter is minimal ingredients I think it is two ingredients no added sugar nothing like that", "and then the jam is also clean ingredients and", "I love", "Trader Joe is because growing up a lot of people used to think it was really bougie but price wise they are actually good", "but I shot a variation of places so that is kind of my number one go to for Oliver", "he loves blackberries blueberries grapes", "so I packed those in his lunch", "I also will pack some almonds maybe some cheese kind of depends", "and then he likes cucumbers so that is why put cucumbers in there as well if I am making this same lunch for Isaiah of course I am going to adjust because grapes are you know what choking hazard so that is why like to cut those up really small", "but this is kind of an idea of a lunch that I would do for Oliver if he is going to school", "and of course I will switch it up change whatever is going in there", "but I try to I have fruit vegetables I like to put nuts in there", "you want to you check with your school because some schools have strict policy about packing nuts his school does not have any policy about almonds so that is why put those in there now if he is at home", "I will do kind of a similar idea so that is why am chopping up some cucumbers and",

in the refrigerator", "what can I throw together what is healthy fresh", "so I will do like cucumber avocado maybe a little and hummus", "I have some cherry tomatoes maybe some cheese maybe if you have some you know turkey breast meat or something that you want to put on there a little bit of pink salt pink Himalayan salt or sea salt", "so anyway it is a pretty big platter whatever he does not finish", "I will eat it because there is always a good amount on there for him to choose from my older son is not a huge fan of meat although we do cook meat every once in a while for dinners and our

them", "they are so good I love them too", "I will actually eat them", "so this is an idea of like a quick throw it in the oven", "we happen to have some cucumbers as well and watermelon", "so if I do not have a watermelon I will do maybe some mango", "or I will do an orange", "and if I do not have cucumber I will do Tomatoes", "and we are actually trying to grow all of these things that we get a lot at the grocery store", "so that is", "why are growing cucumbers tomatoes we are not harvesting enough quite yet to keep up with how much we do eat it", "but hopefully we will get there in the near future", "so that is why am adding this with both of my kids of course for my little one", "I am chopping it", "a lot smaller another favorite this one works for lunch or dinner", "I think on this day

mushroom in it", "they do not have mushroom ones at Trader Joe", "is", "I do not think", "but I mixed the mushroom and then a few of the cheese ones and actually the mushroom our Oliver and my

squash itself is a little bit of a challenge to cut into so that is why have to be pretty careful with it", "I am scooping out the inside", "I am gonna put the inside in my compost Pei", "and then I am gonna cut them into half moon shapes and I am gonna roast them in the oven at about 350 to 400 degrees for about 30 minutes", "or so that is why am gonna add some olive oil salt and pepper on both sides and then on one side I am gonna go ahead and drizzle some honey which is totally optional but it does give it a really nice flavor the outside gets a nice golden brown", "and so that will take

the cumin yogurt next to it", "and you kind of you can actually use the yogurt with everything", "and it tastes good in combination with everything", "but I like a good amount of swiss chard a nice chunk of salad", "and then the roasted squash", "I know some kids are picky eaters but from the time my kids were really little", "I take foods like these and cut it up", "really really small Swiss chard can be kind of tough for kids to eat of course so you can even mash up the squash so that it is like a mashed potato and omit the honey if you want", "but anyway I like to have them try to

together", "it will be kind of cluttered", "and I feel like with two kids and the dogs and the craziness if there is a lot of things that are out of place", "and then it can kind of give the appearance that the house is a lot Messier than what it is", "so just putting everything back in its place cleaning the countertops doing the dishes I spend the most time cleaning in the kitchen for sure", "and that is one of my first priorities in terms of cleaning just because that gets the most foot traffic and so so that is", "why start by cleaning everything in the kitchen", "I clean all the cutting boards", "those are ready to go for making breakfast and lunches and dinners and things like that", "and so everything is kind of clean and ready to go", "I have my compost pail", "and it is good", "so the kitchen I definitely try to get first thing in the morning", "I want to that that is cleanup", "and I usually will have a cup of coffee and clean up the kitchen", "so that is why either

superficial", "but in the kitchen and in the dining room I take a sponge clean the surfaces we have a little area that we make our coffee in the morning that can kind of time to get gross and doing a quick superficial", "clean it could be a half an hour or 15 minutes of going full steam", "and i can definitely get it looking less cluttered and messy", "then it does next", "I am going to move on to

time to encourage them to clean up after themselves", "so that is why finally got hacia off the couch so that is why am gonna take a lint roller my dogs do not shed a whole lot and", "when they do shed it is pretty much in the summer", "and it is just a little bit so their breed does not shed a whole lot", "but I do like to use that to get any hair that did end up on the couch", "and then I spray the couch with the linen spray that I made I think in my last video or maybe two videos ago", "so I am gonna spray that on there and then I put these faux candles with the dogs and kids I do not

wanted to do was pull any clothes that did not fit him because I feel like if I do not clean out their drawers", "at least every two months they end up having clothes that do not fit them", "so that

and jump right in and share them with", "you essence water is not new to my channel but it is a must if you are going to have a spa day or turn your everyday routine into a spa like feel so that is why am taking some lemon balm which I have been growing outside", "it is not doing incredibly row right now", "but I do have a good amount of it", "I am gonna take some peppermint as well", "and I am going to add that with some lemon", "and it is a refreshing herbal essence water you can do so many different varieties", "and I have shared fruit essence waters on my channel before Herbal Essence waters so many different variations I tend to drink a lot of iced tea in the summer months which has caffeine in it", "so if I am trying to kind of cleanse from caffeine or I have been indulging and sugary drinks which I do not drink too often", "but if I am trying to get back to drinking a lot more water I always like to drink essence water because it is more enjoyable to drink in my opinion than just traditional water", "I like this combination", "it is very refreshing", "so I am gonna put that in one of my infuser water bottles and take that with me the next thing that I am gonna make is cooling cucumber", "I d gel which is extremely easy to make I have made this before multiple times", "and I like it", "this also works great for sunburns so perfect for this summer", "I am just gonna cut up some cucumber I happen to have my scissors there from cutting herbs and since I am not ingesting this cucumber", "I am just gonna cut it up put it in there with some aloe vera", "and then I am just gonna blend that", "and this works great for under your eyes you want to stick it in the refrigerator", "it will get it nice and cool it will turn into a nice cooling gel you could put that under your eyes", "but you could also use it on a sunburn and you can use it on your skin in general for deep huffing and cooling I will admit I do not take as many baths in the summer", "but sometimes I will take a nice cool bath if it is feeling really hot outside and if you do not have a bath bomb", "or if you do not have bubble baths you can always use herbs either dried herbs or even fresh herbs so that is why am picking herbs from the garden", "I am gonna take the lemon balm and the peppermint that I already had for my essence water", "I just picked", "a little extra I am picking some eucalyptus", "as well I am gonna pull off the leaves", "and I am gonna rip them apart a little bit and put them inside a muslin bag that is leftover from one of the bath bombs that I used", "and I like to keep those bags", "and then you can go ahead and put this directly on the faucet for your bath", "and then you can take a bath in tea essentially", "and it just smells divine and feels great", "and it is really lovely especially in the summer months", "so that is why can do this any time of the year", "and you can adjust the herbs to fit the season", "but I am gonna go ahead and turn on the water", "and then the water is gonna have a little bit of color in it because it is gonna be infused with the herbs", "but then you can have a really lovely herb back now if you are not a bath person or you are not a bath person in the summer months", "or you do not have a bath", "and you prefer to have the same effect with the shower you can essentially hang herbs from your showerhead", "and I like to hang eucalyptus specifically which you can also find at the grocery store so even if you are not growing it", "no worry I like to hang that from the showerhead and that fills the air of the shower with eucalyptus", "and it smells like a spa", "and you can keep it in there for quite some time because it will dry and you will start to notice if the leaves fall off and they are dropping in the shower you might want to kind of switch it out", "but it will last for a few days sometimes a few weeks depending on the type of eucalyptus that you have", "and it is a really nice addition to the shower you can also try making DIY shower melts which is essentially a bath bomb for the shower", "you are gonna put it at the bottom of your shower", "and it is gonna release the essential oils that you are gonna put in it into the air as well", "so that is another way to kind of make your shower like a spa", "so that is why can make these ahead of time keep them in your bathroom", "and you can drop one of these in your shower whenever you take a shower and that just kind of elevates your shower and makes it feel a little bit more special pretty much we all take showers for the most part every day", "and so it is a little nice addition", "so that is why am starting with baking soda and water", "and I am gonna get that to be like a toothpaste consistency I am adding some lavender a little bit of tea tree oil and some eucalyptus", "and I am gonna mix that together", "and then I am gonna put that in some molds", "and I want to let that dry overnight", "so that is why want that to harden now before I put it in the mold", "I am gonna put some nonstick spray so basically some olive oil", "so that does not stick to the bottom of the molds or completely crumble when it dries this can be tricky you might want to experiment a little bit I have had to do a few different rounds before I really nailed it with these", "so do not be discouraged if you do not nail it on the first try", "but once you do nail it it is really fun because you will have shower melts that last for several weeks", "and you can put them in your shower and enjoy them next", "we are making some mani pedi bombs which are essentially bath bombs but little mini ones so that you can put them in a little manicure bowl or a pedicure bowl when you are giving yourself a manicure pedicure which I have been giving myself manicures and pedicures lately because I have not had the time to go and get one", "so anyway I will put the exact measurements and the ingredients below again you want to experiment with making bath bombs", "you may not nail it on the first try", "but essentially it is Epsom salt baking soda citric acid", "and you have your dry ingredients which you are gonna mix together first", "and then you have your wet ingredients for your wet ingredients you have", "I have coconut oil here", "I have some essential oils that I am gonna add there", "and you slowly very slowly add your wet ingredients to your dry ingredients and the reason you want to add it really slowly", "is because if you add it too quickly it is gonna have that effect that you get when you drop the bath bomb in the water", "it is gonna fizz and you will lose that effect when you actually use it", "so that is why want to be very slow when you add your wet ingredients to your dry ingredients so again experiment have fun with it", "do not be discouraged if you do not nail it on the first try", "but these are fun to use if you are gonna give yourself", "an at home spa day", "so that is why am gonna mix those together", "and then I am gonna put those in my molds", "these are half molds", "so that is why am making basically half dome bath bombs or mani pedi bombs", "and then I am gonna use a spatula to get it in there nice and tight and to pack it in there", "and then again I am gonna let those dry overnight", "and you can use these for manicures and pedicures", "I have a facial steam blend that I also like to use sometimes for manicures and pedicures it", "is basically dried herbs", "it is calendula and rose", "and sometimes I will put that in there", "it is not necessary", "but it adds a little bit of a pretty effect and its really enjoyable so that is why am gonna soak my fingers and", "this is basically since I am outdoors a lot doing a lot of yard work gardening playing outside with my kids", "my hands definitely get gross", "I get dirt underneath my nails which I never liked for the longest time I always like to have perfectly manicured nails",

trim my cuticles", "I use a brush to get rid of any dirt or grime underneath my nails and try to keep them as clean as possible at this point", "sometimes I will paint them if it is a special occasion or if I am gonna be going out or going on vacation or something", "but usually I keep my finger nails without nail polish so it does not chip", "and then I will give myself pedicures as well I do like to paint my toenails I do also trim my cuticles and I use something to get rid of my calluses because I walk outside a lot", "and I have some pretty gnarly calluses", "so my hands on my feet have definitely take a beating taking a beating as I have gotten older but that is okay because the memories that go along with that I think are well worth it", "so if I am giving myself a pedicure I will let my feet soak in the warm water", "I will remove the calluses as best as possible or sometimes I will do this after I have been in the shower if I need to do a pedicure a little quicker anyway",

wanted to let you guys know that this video is sponsored by Grove collaborative they have sponsored a few of my videos in the past", "and I have been a paying customer of theirs for a while", "now they are a delivery service they deliver natural and organic options for cleaning supplies hygiene items baby items", "and I get a box", "every single month they are offering a special to my viewers which is a free gift with purchase for new customers and it is a two times concentrate from seventh generation the wool dryer balls and an essential oil and if you are an existing customer like I am", "they have a free gift as well all that will be in the description so that is why can check that out for the details", "okay", "so that is why am gonna jump into the video and get cleaning starting with the bedding", "I am gonna go ahead and strip all of the bedding and the sheets in my master bedroom and", "my guest bedroom", "I have white sheets", "and then I have white towels in my master", "bedroom", "so that is why wash light colors with light colors so that is why wash all the whites together", "and then I will usually wash all the grace together and my sons both have more gray colored sheets", "so I washed those with the gray bedding washing light colors with like colors", "is pretty standard when it comes to washing bedding so that is why generally stick to that rule", "and I am gonna start with that I have experimented with a lot of different laundry detergents", "and I really like the seventh generation concentrate", "laundry detergent", "they have a four x and", "a two x", "and I use the", "four x right now", "but", "I also have the two time concentrate in my cabinet if you do not want to use bleach to whiten your whites you can use either a natural alternative to that which I have ordered before on Grove or you can use a half a cup of lemon juice", "and you can pour that in with your whites", "and it is gonna help it look a little less dingy and faded and give it a little brightness I only had a few lemons here in this case so I am not using quite half a cup", "but I am putting a little bit in there with my detergent to brighten it up a bit", "wool dryer balls are a great addition to a laundry routine they are used in the dryer", "I have several of them I have talked about them before in my channel", "they are also a great alternative for using dryer sheets because what you can do is you can use them by themselves they actually cut drying time by 25 to 50 percent but they also are great when you use them with essential oils so that is why like to use them especially when I am drying bedding", "I like to use them with a kind of like a sleepytime essential oil or a bedtime essential oil something that has lavender in it", "it leaves a nice but subtle scent on the bedding you could use any essential oil combination that you prefer and switch it up depending on what you are washing and drying", "but it is a nice alternative to dryer sheets I am going to use the same essential oil to make a dreamy linen spray easy to make all you need is a spray bottle I have distilled water in there", "filled up pretty much all the way", "and then I have witch hazel", "and then I am gonna add 10 to 15 drops of an essential oil", "so I am using the nighttime essential oil so that I could spray it on the linens but again you can customize this and totally change it", "however you want it", "I like that because I like to spray it on the sheets and the pillows and the bedding and it has a lavender scent so it is really nice and relaxing next", "I am gonna do a little guest prep in the guest bedroom", "we have my husband is family coming to stay with us", "and then all of us are going camping and someone is gonna be watching my home", "so I like to have a guest basket with a few different things I have facial sponges a body sponge and poo and conditioner", "ear swabs toothbrush toothpaste", "all that jazz", "so that is why usually fill it with any essentials that I think they might need or may have forgotten to that they feel comfortable and", "it varies depending on how much time I have or how rushed I feel when I am getting ready", "but I also put a few little extra goodies in there a facial spray lip balm and then a candle and", "then also you could you know if you wanted to you could put their own laundry detergent in there as well so that they can do their laundry again", "it is customizable", "depends on how much you want to do and what you want to put into it", "but I always like to put a little something together", "and I feel like it is always appreciated", "so I wanted to", "I got that done while I was waiting for the laundry to be finished", "and once the laundry is finished I can start making the bed in the guest bedroom", "so I prefer to fix the bedding as soon as it comes out of the dryer because it has wrinkles at first", "but then if you fix it right away the wrinkles go away", "I am not one to I do not really have the time to steam or iron my sheets although I know some people like to do that", "so that is why like to get the corners really nice", "and I do fold them and tuck it under", "I do not do it every single time", "but I like to do it especially if I am having guests and then for fresh and fluffy towels", "a quick tip is that you can use vinegar so that is why used lemon juice with the whites to give it a little extra brightness we are actually gonna use vinegar to help remove any residue on towels and make them a little fluffier you actually do not need to use any detergent at all you can simply use vinegar and that will make them a little cleaner and fluffier next", "I am gonna make some sachets these can be used under a pillow they can be used on top of towels you can use them in drawers to kind of freshen it up", "so that is why am actually picking some fresh lavender and eucalyptus I am going to pull the lavender apart and just get it separated", "and then I am gonna put it inside a muslin bag", "we actually sell bath bombs in my boutique", "and I keep the muslin bags that the bath bombs come in", "and I reuse them", "so I like to make little sachets with it", "and then I am also going to utilize the eucalyptus", "as well I am gonna take the entire eucalyptus leaf", "and I am going to tie that", "with twine on top of the sachet makes a really pretty presentation but you could take eucalyptus you could buy it from the store you can dry it crinkle it up and put it inside the sachets", "there is a few things you can do with it", "but I think that this makes for a really pretty presentation and it smells lovely if you are not using it for a presentation and you put the herbs inside the bag", "you can also throw that in the dryer and that adds a nice scent as well to towels or bedding or linens I am gonna clean the windows in the guest bedroom now", "and one thing I really have been liking from Grove is their concentrates not their laundry detergent concentrates but also these concentrates here", "I have been ordering the microfiber cloths and pretty much every order", "and then I have been getting their glass spray bottles", "so the concentrates come with three different ones", "a tub cleaner a glass cleaner and all purpose", "and then you take the contents inside the little tube you put it in the glass spray", "and then you fill the rest up with water", "so it saves a lot of space in terms of cleaning supplies and I still like to order some of their seventh generation", "but I have been trying to cut back so that I do not have too many bottles and saving plastic and", "things like that", "so I have been experimenting with the concentrates and liking them", "I share a lot of DIY options but for those of you who do not want to experiment with DIY cleaning concentrates are a nice thing to kind of check out and experiment with and see if you like since I washed all the bedding together", "it is time to do my bed", "this is the master bedroom", "so my husband and I", "this is where we sleep", "and I am gonna go ahead and get everything all put back on the bed laundry", "can definitely be overwhelming so that is why highly recommend focusing on towels linen embedding in one day and then maybe coming back to clothing on a different day that is usually how I do it", "but it is definitely a nice feeling to have clean bedding and towels", "so anyway that completes my little cleaning routine and getting ready for my guests to come", "I hope you enjoyed this video huge thanks to grove collaborative for sponsoring it and check out the free gift with purchase if you are a new customer they are awesome if you have any questions that you want to know I have been a customer for a year", "so ask me in the comments below", "and I d be happy to share", "and I will see you guys in the next video as always thanks for watching", "and I will see you guys next time", "bye"],

arrangements", "sometimes I will do goodies from outside on my property and make an arrangement with that or I will buy some flowers from the store usually when I head to Trader Joe", "is they have good deals on flowers and I will make arrangements I like to make succulents arrangements", "and I like to kind of mess around and experiment I am starting first by picking a few goodies from around my property starting with eucalyptus now", "if you do not have eucalyptus you can find it at most grocery stores", "Trader Joe is has it for a pretty good price", "but I happen to have it", "so that is why am going to pick it", "I have some gardenias that I picked as well", "and I have some wild flowers", "and then I picked up some flowers from the store as a quick and kind of interesting tip", "if you do not have an area to grow your own flowers and to pick them you can actually get a permit to collect plants or plant material from the Forest Service so that is why will give you a list of plants that you cannot pick ones that you can seasonal restrictions different things like that", "and then you can get a license to pick flowers so it is between six and twenty dollars", "but if you were ever interested in foraging you can get one for between six and twenty dollars for the year it kind of depends on the Forest Service", "so something to look into if you are ever interested this particular arrangement", "I am gonna make it is a citrus hydrangea arrangement", "I have a bucket of very cold water here", "I am starting by removing any leaves extra leaves", "and then I am gonna trim the stems to get my desired height", "I usually trim the stems at an angle", "and then I dip it in the cold water and", "that just gives it a little extra preservation as I am prepping the arrangement", "next I am gonna cut some thin slices of lime for the inside of my vase", "I was sent an arrangement years ago that came inside this vase", "and it was so beautiful that I kept it", "so that is why am using the juice of the lime to push it up against the side of the vase", "some of them are gonna fall it wo not be perfect at first", "so that is why have to come back in and rearrange and fix that", "but then I am gonna start placing the flowers in there", "so I have hydrangeas", "and I have bells of Ireland", "these are both from Trader Joe", "is", "so you can get them for a pretty decent price once I have the right height and the amount of flowers that I need for the arrangement", "I am gonna", "just start arranging and getting it to look aesthetically pleasing in my eye", "I am not a florist by any means", "but I like making floral arrangements so over the years I have experimented", "and I do what I like", "and I think looks pretty", "and then I am gonna add some water inside of there", "and I think that this would make a pretty centerpiece for a wedding a bridal shower a potluck any type of get together or party", "or you could use it for around the house or for whatever you want it for", "so this is a little bit more of a formal arrangement another type of arrangement that I like to make is a throw and go with outdoor wild flowers", "so flowers around my property this one is not gonna look as formal", "it is not gonna look as symmetrical or as perfect but that is kind of the point", "it is a little bit more rustic", "so that is why have the eucalyptus I have some wild flowers", "and I am gonna make some arrangements for the bathroom", "I like the eucalyptus in the bathroom because it provides a nice smell", "and then I actually added gardenias to one of them that I will put in my other bathroom and", "this is easy also because I like to throw this in a mason jar", "you can make it easy rustic quick and easy", "but if you like really formal arrangements you may not like this look and feel it is a little bit more wild looking", "but I like that as well last but certainly not least I am gonna make a succulent arrangement I like to keep succulents arrangements usually outside", "so that is why have hanging planter succulents arrangements I have a variety of succulents throughout my house", "and I find for me that they like to be shaded so that is why like to be in the shade outside", "and they do not like to be over watered I went to my local nursery and hand picked a few different shapes and sizes and color combination", "and I am just gonna create an arrangement in one of my galvanized metal containers that I have", "so I am basically whenever you are creating an arrangement", "it is really about what looks aesthetically pleasing to you and your eye so it is all for your enjoyment", "I love succulents arrangements because the hummingbirds like it", "so it draws them they usually eat off of the variety of succulents that has you can see the little stem coming out the top it or the flower rather that is growing the hummingbirds like that", "and so I love to create arrangements", "and so I put the bigger succulents in the middle", "and then I am gonna fill with the different sizes and color combination and try to make a pretty arrangement", "you can also find succulents at Trader Joe", "is they are usually pretty easy to find anywhere and they are between a dollar a dollar fifty apiece", "so it kind of depends", "but it lasts a really long time", "and I find that my succulents likes to be outdoors in the shade and not over watered so that completes the three easy floral arrangements we have a formal arrangement we have an outdoor quick and easy throwing", "go arrangement that is a little bit more rustic and then of course a succulents arrangement so have fun with flowers and plants", "and it should be something that ultimately you enjoy and you enjoy looking at and a creation that you find inspiring", "and I encourage you to experiment because it is a beautiful thing to interact with flowers and plants at least for me it is relaxing and soothing", "so I hope you enjoyed

little tour of our property and I will do a house tour as well soon", "but we are living under a little less than three acres here in Southern California which we never thought we would be able to get to be completely honest with housing prices out here", "but we really lucked out with this spot", "we got a great deal and now we are having fun growing lots of goodies and farming and enjoying our time with our family", "so that is why am gonna give you guys a little tour of our property", "so we have lived here for one whole year now and when we first moved in we experimented with a few different plants", "hey", "you know there you guys one of them was lavender which did", "pretty well it starts to die during the summer", "but it does well in the spring", "and it looks beautiful so that is why actually began to grow more of it", "and then it tripled and quadrupled", "and it is been doing pretty well", "so my husband irrigated it here and", "we are gonna continue to grow even more lavender in this area because it seems to thrive the best out of some of the options that we have tried so that is why are excited about it", "plus it is nice to pick for DIY or for around the house and", "it smells nice", "you are naughty alright", "we also have a good amount of rosemary we have a huge rosemary bush which we use for recipes we use for why use for DIYs infused oils if you are beginning and gardening", "and you want to try out in herb that thrives and does really well rosemary", "is one that does really well and tends to do well in most environments and it just quadruples and gets bigger and bigger and bigger", "so anyway we are big fans of rosemary and we have lots of it", "okay", "so this garden bed was built in one of my DIY videos", "probably six months ago we started prepping soil and growing in here pretty much right away and one of the things we started growing was spaghetti squash which at first was not doing so well", "but then we did a little research on pollinating and we pollinated it", "and now we have our first spaghetti squash so it is cool to see what actually works and what does not work", "but well we have another little one coming in there", "so that is what we have here", "this is the front of our property and we are gonna have more garden beds here in the future we have a few other things we are growing in the front as well", "but we have a good amount of space here", "so that is why have a few things growing and this is what we have growing in the garden bed", "so this is fun we have a few eucalyptus trees on the property", "some of them are fragrant there is different varieties but this one we were trimming at first", "and then my husband decided he wanted to stop trimming it because he realized it was really beautiful smelling eucalyptus it actually smells fabulous", "and I used this for different arrangements I use it for DIYs and actually if you go to Trader Joe is or some grocery stores they actually sell this so that is why are really excited that we have this", "and I use it all the time", "and it smells absolutely divine so along our gate we decided to plant some potato vine it is a very relatively easy to care for evergreen", "and it wraps its tendrils around the gate so that is why wanted to do this for a little bit more privacy", "it is a little harder to care for in the summer", "it just starts to wilt a little bit", "but in the spring it is beautiful", "and it produces these stunning flowers these beautiful little white variety it is like a Jasmine variety", "and this tends to grow alongside tomatoes usually and it is called a potato vine so anyway my husband wrapped the bottom of this because the bunnies the little rabbits do like to munch on it", "but it is growing pretty well", "it is doing well", "and if we continue to grow it it will be a nice little privacy to kind of cover our fence", "a little bit so people ca not see it as easy", "all right", "so that is why actually have two portions of our property we have an inner portion", "is like our backyard", "and then we have the outer portion of our property and everything is gated", "but so we let our dogs kind of roam around the entire property but in terms of our kids it is nice to have an inner portion of the backyard", "this is the outer portion of our property we have a nice big mountain here", "we have a trench for rainy season so that we do not get flooding", "and we have actually started to clear out for the summer in the spring", "it gets really beautiful grass", "and it is nice and pretty in green", "and then in the summer everything dies", "and we have to clean it up", "so it is not a fire hazard", "we have plans for what we are gonna do for it", "but it is definitely a nice big job and a lot of work so slowly but surely we are kind of cracking away at it", "and so a lot of you are curious because it seems like it is not clear what which part is our property but", "the entire property is gated in and then we have an inner portion of our backyard as well", "so over here on this side of the property it is just outside of our inner backyard", "we have a another garden bed and my husband", "actually he is", "it is cool if you follow us on Instagram", "you can kind of see like the daily adventures of our garden and", "our I guess little farm that we are building here", "but he he has this week this garden bed was here when we came", "and he actually built this little contraption here because we have a lot of little critters trying to eat everything that we are growing", "we are growing cucumbers various squash we also have some peppers and he actually changed this from mesh", "it was originally like a plastic to metal because the bunnies were eating through it", "so he is doing a good job of also providing shade for everything that we are growing", "so far we are doing", "pretty well there is a few things that are thriving", "and it is all one big experiment when you are gardening but so far so good", "so this is our little setup over here", "we also have our compost over here", "and this is where we are anything that is kind of rotting or going bad in terms of produce is put in here and reused to add nutrients to our soil so", "that is what the compost is for", "so this was actually our first year experimenting with a pumpkin patch takes about a hundred and thirty days for pumpkins to grow", "so that is why started them in the summer", "and we are hoping to have a little luck although it does seem like the little critters and our dogs are very interested in the pumpkins", "so we have a little growth here", "but we actually grew three different varieties of pumpkins or are trying to grow three different varieties we have fairytale pumpkins giant pumpkins and then jack o lanterns", "so that is why are gonna see come fall", "what actually grew but", "it is all one big experiment and we definitely wanted to have a pumpkin patch and if we do not do it this year we are gonna try again next year and hopefully have plenty of pumpkins for the kids and around the house so inside the inner portion of our property which is kind of like the official backyard where the kids play we have our little grassy area and our big tree and then over here", "we are creating our urban tea garden and", "we are gonna kind of move the rocks and create pathways at some point", "but it is a little bit at a time there is a little work every single day", "so we have lots of different herbs we are growing we have sage we have got chamomile", "we have time we have basil we have different varieties of mints", "we are and we also have our citrus trees as well", "so those are over here", "and they are kind of growing", "and they are doing well", "and they are thriving so that is why are happy about it and then also in front of my studio", "we have some flowers we have got some gardenias we have some more chamomile a few other citrus trees we got this tractor which Byron is definitely on more than I am", "but we got this so that we could clean up the property because obviously in the spring it grows", "and then the summer everything dies and there is a lot of work to be done we have been cleaning up a lot with it", "and it is been fun", "it is been a lot of fun I do not have the key", "so that is why ca not turn it on write it for you", "but it is been a good time", "okay", "so that is it for the outside of our property which is definitely a big job in and of itself", "but I am gonna have to bring you inside soon not today", "but I

together or you can use them separately but they are a great dinner or lunch", "and so I am just gonna jump right in and share with you the recipes so that is why think most of us can agree that nacho cheese is not the healthiest item on the menu", "so that is why am actually making a vegan nacho cheese which was a crowd pleaser at", "first everybody was like what is this gonna taste like", "is this gonna be good", "but it is vegan approved because the person who films my cooking video Shane he is a vegan my husband is not a vegan and he absolutely loved this", "he was like blown away by this recipe and both of them were looking at me like I have no idea", "if this is gonna turn out any good", "it is definitely a less guilty version of nacho cheese because this particular recipe is made with raw cashews nutritional yeast sea salt garlic powder cumin and chili powder so that is why am actually adding those ingredients together in a blender and blending it up until it is smooth

am gonna give that a nice good blend", "and then I am gonna add a little bit of water slowly until I get a nacho cheese consistency and let me say this is amazing it beats out traditional nacho cheese", "it is healthier for you", "it is better", "I have definitely had my fair share of nacho cheese at different sporting events and movie theaters and things like that but go for the plant based version rather than the processed version it is so worth it and so good", "and it was a total crowd pleaser and everybody loved it", "so this recipe was actually not mine", "I got it from the minimalist", "Baker", "I love her recipes", "I have tested out a ton and shared a few here on my youtube channel so check her out but", "the nacho cheese recipe was actually her", "so I made that for my tostadas", "I am actually gonna set some aside because you can actually dip chips in it and have it as like a nacho cheese with chips but then you can also use it for the tostada I am gonna be making", "so I have tostada shells the flat ones I am adding some black beans that I cooked up", "I get canned black beans at Trader Joe", "is", "so that is why cooked", "those up those are great for all sorts of different recipes", "I use them a lot", "and then I am gonna add a good amount of the vegan nacho cheese on top of that", "and then I am gonna start adding my toppings and you can kind of pick and choose what you would like or", "not like I am gonna add some avocado which I absolutely love and have to have on a tostada", "and then I am gonna add some red onion some lettuce some tomato I am gonna add some of the nacho cheese as well", "and then I am gonna sprinkle that first part of the powder that I left aside and put that on the very top to finish it off", "you know it is a good recipe when everybody finishes what is in their plate or on their plate and comes back for seconds and thirds", "this was a total winner which is why I wanted to share it here", "I love this recipe I have made it a few times and it is so good", "plus you can keep some of the black beans and the nachos on the side and use those as dips so you can have chips and dip you can have your tostada", "and then if you are feeling like you want some guac", "as well I am gonna share with you guys a really easy guac recipe that my husband taught me which is very similar to the one at Chipotle", "I am gonna start by picking some fresh cilantro for the guacamole from our herb garden we actually started growing this cilantro from seed", "and it is doing really well if you want to keep up with our gardening adventures and our day to day life", "we actually share that on my Instagram stories I am usually instagramming pretty much every day on stories sharing what is going on around our house every day so pretty much daily updates of our home our garden and our family are over there on my Instagram so that is why can check that out", "I am starting with avocado", "obviously I have some lime juice cilantro red onion I also have some pickled peppers those little yellow peppers I am gonna dice those up really small and put those in there those add a little bit of a kick which tastes absolutely

times there is harsh elements in the water that we use on our hair and also depending on what type of shampoo you are using that can be harsh on your hair as well so a little coat of coconut oil in

the bottom of a car or on car seats", "I know it sounds kind of gross", "but when we went on our road trip we take our dogs", "so we did have a little bit they do not shed too much in general", "I have Labs and they do not shed that bad", "but they shed a little bit in a squeegee can help pick that up so the next thing that I did", "was remove anything in the car that can be removed and washed

pulled him out took him over to the sink and gave him a good scrub", "but I think you could also put them on the top rack of your dishwasher if you wanted to do that", "so those were nice and clean I

it together", "and then I put it on the seats I leave it for about 15 to 20 minutes", "and then I vacuum it up", "I clean off the seats a little bit with a damp cloth if I get you know", "if there is

the last few weeks we had this area in our dining room going into our kitchen", "that was kind of a dead space", "we had a nice big piece of furniture there as you can see here", "so that is why decided to add a window for us when we first purchased this home there was definitely several things that we looked at and thought that we would want to improve or change down the line", "but you know with any home it is little by little", "we felt like the window was a really great addition it added a lot of light to the dining room and kitchen", "it also added a beautiful view from the kitchen it also added the illusion of a lot more space so it is nice to also be able to see out that direction we get a better view", "so that is why are really happy with it so that of course led to a DIY project because when we had to adjust the furniture to accommodate the new window we were left with some extra wood so that is why came up with the idea of creating a bench we had been shopping for a bench for our dining room table to add more space when we had lots of people over", "and we had been shopping for one", "and I thought we should upcycle the wood and build one ourselves so the big piece of furniture has kind of like a distressed white paint on it", "so that is why went ahead and painted the top portion of the bench so that is why was trying to do this project", "my husband was helpful with this one because I was holding my son Isaiah he wanted to be held and snuggled so", "I was actually holding him while my husband finished this up and", "it is kind of like a back and forth whenever we are doing a project it is also trial and error whenever we are doing a project because it is figuring out the right angles also figuring out the right support system in terms of creating a bench at first", "we did not have enough support so that is why had an additional support to the bottom", "so we both kind of sat there and tried to figure it out", "and it ended up turning out pretty cool", "and it was completely up cycled from a piece of furniture that we had to kind of rethink because we added the window so luckily nothing had to go to waste", "and we did not have to spend any additional money on getting something that we had been wanting for the dining room so as mentioned before my husband created these kind of V legs that went on either end and that was definitely not enough support on its own from that v", "we created two additional pieces of wood that came to a center point about 3 4 of the way well towards the end of the bench as you can see here", "and then we had to add an additional support as well going down the middle so that people can actually sit on this bench", "and they wo not fall and hurt themselves", "so I love it too because we can keep our chairs", "but then we have this nice long bench at the other side", "and then it opens up the space even more so that you can see out", "and we are happy with how it turned out plus", "it matches we did not have to spend a penny", "it was awesome so those two touches definitely finish up that room which is nice", "we have to add shutters so the shutters are not there quite yet",

sticky I wanted to", "I went and worked with all the windows", "so here is my little cleaning room", "this is actually my laundry room where I keep all of my cleaning supplies", "I have my microfiber cloths and things up here", "I actually tried to really simplify this and also not have anything that I do not need in there", "I d like to have it", "you know look even prettier", "but I have to be pretty realistic with the fact that when I clean I am usually moving pretty fast and everything has to be accessible", "so I have a little basket for my dryer ball as my essential oils", "I have a basket for my microfiber", "cloths my towels", "so that is why have my laundry detergent", "and", "I also have Clorox", "because sometimes I do Clorox bleach my towels the white towels that I use for cleaning", "and then I have a basket with all of my sprays", "so what I use for when the dogs have an accident some disinfectant spray window spray all purpose I have a toilet bowl cleanser and then", "I also have the cleanser for the floors now today I am focusing on the windows so that is why am gonna be cleaning the windows and the little crack at the bottom of the window gets extra dirty", "so that is why wanted to go through my house and clean all of those it took a few days to get around to all of them", "but if I am not using something that I have in terms of cleaning supplies that I buy from the store or online", "I usually just DIY it", "so in this case I have some baking soda and vinegar", "it creates a little bubbly reaction", "and then if an old toothbrush you can clean that area of your windows scrub scrub scrub brush brush brush", "and then you can take a cleaning towel and a butter knife to get rid of any additional residue like the baking soda or any leftover vinegar and suggest continue to clean so that is why tried to get it as clean as possible so much better alright", "I also live out in the country where there are lots of pests and bugs and one little quick tip", "is that they generally do not like peppermint so if you put a little tiny bit of peppermint on a paper towel and just rub it against the window it kind of prevents spiders and bugs and things from collecting there it does help a little bit obviously you know when you live in certain areas bugs and pests", "are kind of inevitable", "but it does help the other thing that I wanted to do as well was go to all of my windows and spray it with a little wd 40 some like Tin Man action here to try to get all of my windows to open and close smooth because that is frustrating to go and try to open a window", "and it is sticky", "I also cleaned all the windows themselves so that they were not dirty and gross looking so the inside and the outside", "so this is kind of a big job depending on how big your house is so that is why say start with a window or two everyday and just try to get it done when you can or spend a full day if you have that to try to clean them all", "but it can be daunting to do them all so a little bit at a time", "is usually how I tackle these types of projects adding a little bit of wd 40", "it is gonna help make a sticky window a little bit more smooth", "so it is

why pack a short sleeved shirt a long sleeve shirt and a sweater", "I brought a hat with me as well because when you are not showering you are obviously not washing your hair dry shampoo can help but

is the key", "so that is why had shorts I had pants sweaters beanies warm booties anything I could think that I could layer in case", "they are cold and uncomfortable and so I tried to fit everything

car", "but I also pack an emergency bag of medications and different things like that asthma", "medicine benadryl there is lots of bees when you camp Tylenol anything you think you might need in terms

water so that is why let it air dry", "and they are clean so that is why have sippy cups plenty of wipes diapers for", "however long you are gonna be there puree", "so that is why made sure to pack

working on a little makeshift fix to prevent any critters from getting in and nibbling on the things that are growing but right now what we are growing and what is doing well is squash", "we are growing some carrots", "and then we are also growing some radishes I think having a garden is a really fun family experiment because it really teaches you a lot", "and it is fun for kids as well to see what is growing", "and then how we can best utilize what is growing some things that we plan to grow we wanted for everyday use", "but we also wanted for landscaping purposes and we tested out", "several different plants lavender was one that thrived and did", "well it quadrupled and we loved the idea of having tons of lavender in our front yard so that is why have been adding slowly and that is continuing to grow and we hope to add even more lavender today", "we are adding to my herb garden collection by creating a tea garden so that is why will be transplanting several tea herbs some of the things that we grow have been from seeds but lots of things have thrived as a transplant although transplanting can be kind of it may not always work but for us it has been a good way to see what does work and in this case I am starting with a few containers and I am prepping the soil my aunt is a phenomenal gardener she gave us a fantastic recipe for a soil blend which we have been trying out", "and it is been working great", "so thank you aunt Ann for that", "and my mom also loves to garden so it is all about trial and error and in this case I wanted to plant a few different versions of mint", "so I am gonna plant chocolate mint orange mint peppermint and spearmint so that is why am excited to see if these thrive and which ones do", "well I will keep you posted on that", "but I already started creating blends from these herbs and have made some herbal teas and herbal infusions and waters and a few recipes that I will share with you guys in this video", "so I did several different versions of mint excited to see how those do", "and then I did lemon balm lemon grass lemon verbena", "and", "I also did chamomile as well so far the chamomile seems like it is having a hard time because all of the little flowers are being eaten so that is why am gonna kind of have to experiment a little bit more with that", "but everything else seems to be doing okay", "since I started my little tea garden some of these have to be specially requested from a local nursery", "but I am kind of roughing up the bottom and transplanting them hoping that they thrive and I will keep you posted on which ones do", "but I already started clipping them drying them and making all sorts of fun recipes so now", "if you have a variation of herbs you can have fun with some herbal creations", "so first I am gonna be clipping a few of my orange mint and my chocolate mint", "and I am gonna create a few different blends so right now", "I am just picking a few of the chocolate mint leaves", "I am also picking some lemon verbena and some peppermint now we already have sage thyme and rosemary that is thriving and doing really well and growing and", "one thing you can do is dry your herbs and create herbal infusions but also any of those herbs can be used for cooking and also used for tea infusions as well", "so that is why have an herb dryer here we actually are carrying these in my shop at Pacific time", "I am obsessed with it", "I have used it several times and basically I hang up my herbs and let them dry", "and you can use them for all sorts of fun things so right here", "I am drying some sage and some thyme and then", "I also picked some lavender from the lavender that we are growing and also several of the mints", "and I am gonna create some different teas and herbal", "blends", "many of these need to be trimmed regularly and so even if you do not use it for an herbal blend or for cooking", "you can", "no way scrunch it up and put it right back into your compost and back into your soil so here I actually dried some herbs and I am gonna be making a tea I have peppermint and lemon verbena", "and I am gonna basically also you could do chocolate mint if you wanted or any of the things that I planted in my tea garden could be used and", "you dry it out once it is dry", "i crinkle it up a little bit", "I put it inside a tea infuser", "and I put hot water in and basically make myself a delicious cup of tea you could also put in a tea bag", "you can have a lot of fun experimenting with several different blend combinations", "if you do not want to dry your herbs you can make a Sun tea", "so right now I am picking some fresh lavender I am gonna add some chocolate mints and a few other herbs from the garden I am gonna make sure they are really washed well", "and I am also gonna put that in a mason pretty large mason jar and add some tempered water", "and then you can sit that in the Sun and it creates a Sun tea you can add ice", "and it is a yummy iced tea especially going into the summer", "it is fresh", "I decided to pair lavender and chocolate mint because I feel like those complement each other", "they remind me of some culinary dishes and so that is why kind of wanted to test that out", "so you put that in a sunny spot", "and you let that sit in the Sun for eight hours to create a Sun tea", "and you can do that", "with all sorts of different blends and ice it we have a lot of rosemary and rosemary is thriving and doing pretty well", "so that is why love to pick some fresh rosemary and you can put that in oils and you can use that for cooking so", "you have rosemary infused oils olive oil avocado oil for cooking", "but I am also going to do a lavender infused avocado oil for your body", "so that is why could use it for your body", "you could use it for cooking and there is so many different ways to get good use out of your herbs", "there are so many good reasons to have an herb garden so many fun creations I love that you can do body products you can cook with it you can enjoy tea and different blends", "and so that is", "why hope this video gave you some inspiration to start a garden for yourself whether it is a tea garden or an herb garden and experiment with it for yourself", "I hope you guys enjoy my channel", "thank you for watching this episode of my garden diary keep an eye out for future episodes

other series that I have started in the past like my garden diary and my cooking videos", "but this is the launch of a new one called around the house where basically I am going to share with you guys a compilation of DIYs and projects that I have been working on around my house over the last week or several weeks", "so it will be a little bit random because it is gonna be all over the house but in this series you are gonna get a bunch of different ideas that hopefully inspire you for some possible ideas for around your house so today we are doing a few things in my kids bathroom", "we are also doing some things outside inside in the kitchen and the hallway and a bunch of things that I have been working on", "so we are gonna jump right in first with the kids bathroom been wanting to make a dino toothbrush holder for my son Oliver so that is why bought a few dinosaurs from Michaels and I am readjusting this one to make it a toothbrush holder Michaels carries a set of about 4 to 5 dinosaurs so my son was very excited because he got to keep the dinosaurs that I was not using for the toothbrush holder", "so I made sure to secure the dinosaur I removed a few of the spikes I felt kind of bad for the dinosaur for doing that", "but then I drilled two large holes that would fit two toothbrushes in there so that both of my sons can use this and then basically I used a really large drill bit that was big enough probably about tooth brush size", "and I drilled all the way through", "and then I had two holes to fit the toothbrushes", "and so then when you put the toothbrushes in it makes up for where the spikes were so", "then you have a dinosaur toothbrush holder", "the next project we decided to make was a monster rock doorstop so that we can keep the door open and the kids bathroom that goes out to the yard so that is why want to grab a nice size rock from outside that can keep the door open and then have fun with it and let your kids be creative", "you could do animal creatures in this case", "we decided to do a monster rock", "so that is why did yellow and green we have non toxic kid paints here and", "then like kid brushes and", "we have a nice little bin in his bedroom of all of our little art supplies and art projects", "so that is why like to try to do art projects when we get a chance to", "and then we have this puff paint that is non toxic as well", "but it is glow in the dark we put some spots on the monsters back", "and then we created a face", "and I think the whole key is to just be creative and have fun", "we originally took a rock from outside to keep the door open and", "then him and", "I decided it would be fun to paint it and be creative with it", "and so that is why can make these even for fun even if it is not for a doorstop so this works perfect for the doorstop oliver has", "his cousin is over and they are running around and playing outside and so that is why they can come in and out", "and they can either wash up from playing outside or they can use the restroom", "so this is how the monster rock turned out", "and I think it looks great", "it is fun to be creative next", "I am making some shelving for the bathroom", "as well I am staining some wood here", "I got this woodcut at Home Depot", "so that is why measured the area in the boys bathroom that I wanted for the shelving", "and then I got it cut accordingly", "and then right here I am staining", "I am actually in my garage whenever I stain I try to be in the garage and then keep the doors open so that I have plenty of ventilation", "and I am staining it a dark brown", "of course you can keep it the original color if you want", "but I always like to stain it because a lot of the wood in my home is a little bit of a deeper color so that is why am just staining this", "and then I am gonna let that dry", "and then", "I also have some hardware here", "so that is why have some wall hooks some turnbuckles and some mounting hardware", "so what I am gonna do here is I am kind of brushing it lightly with some black paint I am doing a very light brushstroke so that a little bit of the metal shows through", "but you could certainly paint it so that it is stark black", "and then I am gonna", "just let that dry", "and then I am gonna create holes in the wood and basically start to mount with my hardware this shelving that I want in the bathroom", "there were some other shelving that was there before", "so that is why am gonna have to go and paint over the holes as you can see there", "but this is kind of hanging shelving", "I do want to get some l brackets to make it a little bit more stable but for the meantime I am just putting some light things on the shelving like a few towels and a little succulents and some tissue and keeping it pretty simple", "so so far it stayed pretty steady", "but I did go ahead and add some L brackets to give it an even more secure finished product you can also go back and kind of brush up on any I", "there is a few black spots that I kind of wanted to go and finish up and fix on the hardware", "but it finished up the bathroom nice", "and I definitely wanted shelving there because it felt a little empty in that space", "so I created that to finish up the boys bathroom next", "we are moving into a few different areas in the house I have some wood crepe boxes that were left here from the previous owners they were hung on the wall a little differently", "I basically kind of flipped it and re hung it in the kitchen", "and then I have some thin pieces of wood here that I nailed into the box", "I am painting that with chalkboard paint", "and I am gonna let that dry", "what I am using this for is produce", "I am actually gonna put my onions and potatoes inside of these so as you can see it kind of doubles here as a little stop so that the potatoes and onions do not completely fall out since the opening is facing out instead of facing up", "and then the chalkboard paint allows it to act as a label so that is why can actually write what is inside of the box", "so in this case I am gonna have onions and potatoes so that they are at an arm", "is reach and they are easy to grab this idea works great for the items that are not kept in the refrigerator but need to be kept out", "and it keeps everything at an arm", "is reach so that is why can grab it when you are getting ready to cook so moving into the hallway", "I have pictures all over the house", "but I want the hallway to be covered in frames and family pictures", "so that is why have these wall hooks", "and then I have loop screws", "so I put the wall hooks into the wall first", "and then I screw the loop screws into the top of the frame", "and then I hang the frame so that is why so all my frames are hung that way you can buy frames in bulk on Amazon", "so that is why come with the same finish but in a bunch of different shapes and sizes", "but I have all sorts of different frames and", "I will kind of retouch on this later once I add all the pictures we are gonna do another family photo shoot", "and I am slowly adding pictures I will come back to the hallway and my next around the house video to kind of show you the finished product", "but I want to show you how I hang those next I wanted to make some arrangements for around the house", "so I have these beautiful galvanized planters we actually sell these in the shop", "I have the large medium and small sizes I am gonna actually work with the large and small size to make some moss arrangements", "so here I have some living moss which is actually kind of challenging to find I found it at my local nursery", "and I have seen these moss arrangements before they are beautiful", "but they are kind of hard to maintain in the sense that a lot of celebrities have them in their home and of course they hire someone not to make them but to rotate them from the inside to outside because moss does like to live in ambient light outside so what I did was I bought some moss for", "about 19 99 arrangements cost significantly more to purchase", "so that is why wanted to mess around with it it comes in like little mounds", "so that is why am pulling them apart", "and I am adding them slowly to create a beautiful arrangement", "and I always go with my eye whenever I am making an arrangement I just kind of go with what looks pretty and at first it kind of looks like a mess but", "as you add it you want the entire top to be green", "and then it ends up looking like a pretty simple arrangement that you want to keep outdoors most of the time", "but you can bring it in for special occasions or", "when you have guests over finally I want to add to my collection outside of hanging plants I have hanging plants inside in my studio and in my bathroom", "but", "I also have several hanging succulents plants outside because I love that they draw the hummingbirds", "so I have this galvanized planter that is a hanging version of the galvanized planters", "this one is also in my shop and then I bought some sealants from my local nursery", "it is perfect for outside because it is pretty easy to maintain it does not need to be watered too much", "it also brings the hummingbirds out because it does flower a little bit and", "the hummingbirds really like the flowers so little by little I add to my home and one thing that I learned is that you do not create a home overnight", "I feel like you create it in a lifetime and also little by little little DIYs and little projects that you add to your home that makes it feel like yours one project at a time one DIY", "at a time it all happens a little bit over time and so that is why I wanted to share this series with you so keep your eyes out for the next episode of around the house

pieces in my closet so a habit that I tried to implement whenever I get new clothing if it is more than like one or two pieces I will go into my wardrobe and clear it out so that is why will take out items that I am not wearing anymore or that I want to donate", "you can also sell your items on thread up and", "if there is ever an item that I feel like I d rather sell I will do that but a lot of times I usually just donate almost everything", "so that is why do pull it out of a closet I put it in a bag", "and I donate whatever I do not want anymore", "and then I reorganize I do like to kind of color coordinate in there", "I take out any extra hangers I try to even everything out", "so it looks nice and clean", "and I can actually see the items that I have in there", "and it is not a hot mess I try to be active pretty much every day", "so I have a nice collection of activewear", "and I am always looking for good deals especially when it comes to designer activewear", "so that is why

down to 17 99 and", "then again I got an additional 30 off", "so that is why got both of these pieces for under 35 which you could not even get one of those retail price for that", "and I feel like if I showed up", "no one would ever know that this was consignment but", "if they asked I would 100 share because sharing is caring especially when it comes to getting good deals for cute clothes so

want to everything", "is clean and organized so that you know I am being responsible with the ones that I have and taking good care of the clothes that I have because I do like to keep them in good shape", "and they last for a really long time I picked up a few casual pieces as well from the site", "one thing that I love is flannel", "I love flannel all year round because in the summer I wear it

was", "I actually moved to my shorts", "they were in a drawer before", "but I have a little cubby in my closet so that is why stack the shorts on top of each other in that cubby", "and then so that is

never spend", "I love it", "it is super cute", "but I would never buy this dress for three hundred and sixty seven dollars", "I will be honest right off the bat with you", "so that is why was happy

lot of boot camp weight training", "and I am trying to gain some muscles so that is why have been needing to up my protein", "a little bit so that is why have been boiling eggs at about 8 minutes and 30 seconds once the water starts boiling", "I set a timer and", "then that gives it a nice", "it is kind of like a soft boiled egg", "so what I do is I make my avocado toast", "and I put it on a

there", "and then I am gonna squash that up just similar to what I would do if I was making guacamole then once my Ezekiel bread is toasted up and this is all while the eggs are boiling I am gonna go ahead and put that on top of the Ezekiel bread like what I would do for avocado toast and in this case what I do", "that is like a little bit different", "is I", "I toss up some arugula with some avocado oil again a little bit of Himalayan salt", "and then I top the entire thing with some chili flakes so that is why have kind of this like arugula salad on top of the avocado toast", "and then you have your protein", "as well you could obviously omit that if you you know do not like eggs or do not eat eggs but in this case I am trying to up my protein a little bit", "so I am adding that

different in this case", "you could certainly use grilled chicken if you wanted to", "but I am using tofu here", "and I am taking a paper towel to remove any extra liquid inside the tofu it does help the tofu kind of crisp up a little bit more", "so that is why am cutting the tofu into cubes I am using some avocado oil which I like", "it has the highest smoke point", "so essentially it can heat up the highest before it starts to lose its nutrients out of any other oil", "so I am just putting the tofu into a pan with some avocado oil and", "I am gonna kind of lightly sear both sides of the tofu and get it nice and cooked up next", "I am adding green onion carrot and peas", "and then I am adding a little bit of garlic as well", "so that is why am gonna let that all kind of sear together",

low sodium soy sauce or a little bit less salt", "so it does not have too much salt in there and then", "I also like to add some yuzu which is what I am adding here", "it is basically like lime a special kind of lime juice which is good", "I like lots of lime in my fried rice", "so I put that and a little bit of soy sauce", "I am gonna give it a nice good mix", "and then it is pretty much

it all", "right now we are moving on to quinoa tacos", "these were good and I am excited to share these with you", "so that is why am starting with some avocado oil", "and then I am gonna put some quinoa directly into the pan", "so this is very similar to how I would cook regular tacos", "I would put my oil at the bottom of the pan", "and then I would put my ground turkey or meat or whatever in the pan", "and then I would add water and", "what I do is I add water", "I let it cook I add a little bit more", "water let that cook down", "and I do that about three or four times", "so it softens the meat in this case", "I am pretty much doing the same thing with the quinoa", "and I am adding my taco seasoning to the quinoa just like I would if I was cooking with me", "so essentially I am replacing me with quinoa and it turned out really delicious", "everybody liked it add more flavor to the quinoa I actually used veggie broth instead of water", "which is normally what I would do",

some canned corn and also some canned black beans you could do everything fresh if you wanted to", "but I love these kind of quick and easy throw and go recipes you can do this on the stove", "but you can also do this in a crock pot so if you wanted to kind of get that going", "and you have a few errands you want to run", "and you want to get that going and have it ready when you get home", "you could certainly do that", "but I am gonna put a top on and let that cook for a little bit", "and then once it is done", "it is easy ready to go pour into a bowl add some cheese and tortilla chips and

in the a m I start by cleansing my skin", "I use", "my Clarisonic I would say probably every other day I have the ultra gentle brush head", "it is a little bit longer than the others", "and I use the Clarisonic Mia", "I use that with the Clarisonic cleanser that it usually comes with and this is like a brightening cleanser", "so that is why usually just start by cleansing my skin", "this particular cleanser is a cream cleanser", "and I like to remove cream cleansers with a damp cloth", "so that is what I am gonna do here", "I have a little bit of melasma some hyperpigmentation leftover from my second pregnancy", "so I have been using some brightening products I have this glam glow mask that I have been using and the instructions say to use it a few days in a row and then go to once a week and", "then every other week so that is why have been following the instructions I do not use it every single day", "but I have been using it a few days in a row", "this mask also doubles as an exfoliant", "so when you first put it on your skin you are gonna treat it like an exfoliant and then leave it on for about 20 minutes", "and it does brighten I would say if you are dealing with a lot of melasma or hyperpigmentation a mask like this is not quite strong enough but it can definitely improve while the mask is drying I am gonna go ahead and use my KP duty derma dr resurfacing pads", "I have the face and body ones I absolutely love these", "I used the vitamin C peel pads for my face", "and then I recently got these for my body", "and I put it on my arm my chest obviously if I am getting out of the shower", "I will put it all over my entire body", "but I do focus on my arms or the areas of my body that are usually exposed", "this is a active peel pad", "so you want to that if your skin is sensitive you are gonna be sitting out in the Sun to keep an eye out for that and follow the instructions and then after I am done with that", "then I just removed the mask", "now I do not use the mask every single day but every day after I cleanse my skin I do use my vitamin C peel pads", "the vitamin C peel pads are pretty active so you may not want to use them directly after using the masks", "you kind of just want to gauge how sensitive your skin is", "I personally did", "but you want to follow the instructions and wash off the vitamin C peel pad after about thirty seconds", "or so that is why am a big believer in vitamin C because it brightens lightens and tightens the skin so that is why love those peel pads I have been obsessed with them for a few years", "now they also have a product called wrinkle revenge that has hyaluronic acid in it", "and I like to look for products with hyaluronic acid because hyaluronic acid is naturally occurring in our body but it is slowly over time as we get older it diminishes and", "what it does is it actually holds a thousand times its weight in water", "so it gives you plump skin like babies have a lot of hyaluronic acid in their skin", "so a product that contains hyaluronic acid is gonna make your skin look plump and glowy and dewy that combination together is like a miracle it is gonna give your skin that glow that I feel like everybody wants then after that I am using the CC cream with SPF 50", "the it cosmetics CC cream", "and I use this every day to kind of like you know for the sunscreen purposes and then to even out", "and I use like a tiny bit", "I use a foundation brush to apply this onto my skin", "I do get like a little redness under my eyes when I am tired", "I am not sleeping very well these days well I am sleeping a little bit better because Isaiah is starting to be better about sleeping through the night but slowly but surely", "it is getting better", "so that is why do like to use something to just kind of even out my skin tone the little tiny bit of melasma that I do have it kind of conceals and covers up", "and then I do put a concealer under my eyes and", "I am also using the it cosmetics concealer after I have applied the CC cream and concealer", "then I kind of look a little bit one color so that is why usually like to put a little bit of blush on", "and I pretty much wear blush every single day", "a little bit so that is why am using this Jesse J palette by makeup forever", "I am going to give a little smoky smile and put a little bit of blush there", "and then I used the Elizabeth Arden 8 hour cream on my lips it prevents dry lips I have been using it for years and", "that really helps", "and then I am gonna use a little bit of mascara", "and that is pretty much all I do every day and at this point it is pretty fast", "like I get this done and over with within a few minutes", "so it might seem like it takes a long time", "but it does", "not I slap on my skin care and makeup", "and I am done for the day for a night time", "I keep it pretty simple", "as well I usually take my shower at night when my kids go to sleep", "so I like to light a candle and if I am in the shower I usually wash my face in the shower in this case", "I am washing my face over the sink", "and then the three ingredients that I think are winners for my skin", "and I stick with our vitamin C and hyaluronic acid in the day and retinol at night", "I also do have some Retin A which is prescription", "and I only use that on occasion because retin a does make your skin peel", "and then I have to pull back on some of the other things that I am using that are active like vitamin C because my skin is pretty sensitive when I am using retin a so on a daily basis I am using retinol and the retinol that I use", "is by Kate Somerville", "what retinol does is it increases cell turnover", "so it basically increases your skin to slough off and bring new skin and collagen so when you are using vitamin C to brighten lighten and tighten hyaluronic acid to moisturize and retinol at night", "you are gonna notice a huge difference in your skin and then for my eyes I am using a deep puffing stick from Kate Somerville", "I get a little puffy again sleeping thing and also as I have gone into my 30s", "I have been kind of wanting to experiment with non invasive treatments like lasers there are a variety of different lasers based on your age range and what you are looking for in your skin", "I recently tried out the laser Genesis at Kate Somerville", "and I wanted to show you guys what it looked like I do go into a little bit more detail of this treatment on my blog", "but basically I wanted to experiment with some non invasive lasers and you can do these occasionally to increase collagen production in your skin and give your skin and overall youthful appearance so lasers are a great way because you do not have any downtime and they are non invasive", "so if you want to know more you can check that out on my blog", "Thanks", "oh it did not hurt at all", "just felt like kind of like warm hot", "we rain", "drops", "you could definitely feel it but no burning or anything a little like a little got a little sunburn or something", "so that is pretty much the extent of my skincare routine", "I am a big believer in vitamin C hyaluronic acid and retinol", "and I try to include those three ingredients into my skincare routine and that is pretty much what I do", "so hopefully you guys enjoy this video and", "you get some tips from it",

supplies for around the house now I do buy a lot of my cleaning supplies", "and I have been trying to switch to a lot more green options", "but you can make a lot of different cleaning supplies for very affordable prices and easy", "so that is why am gonna share with you guys a few of my favorites", "and we are gonna jump right in", "so that is why recently got a book that is a great resource for tons and tons of recipes for DIY green cleaning around the house", "and I would highly recommend picking up this book", "it has tons of different ideas", "one thing it does suggest which a lot of people know is to take off your shoes before coming into the home now believe it or not not everybody grew up having to do this in their home so that is why do not like to go around and enforce that for everybody", "but we are trying to work on indoor shoes and outdoor shoes because on hardwood floors a lot of times people prefer to wear shoes so that is why have indoor shoes and outdoor shoes", "and it does make for a much cleaner home the next thing I am making is a DIY furniture refresher", "this is nice to spray on bedding or your couch", "and it is basically distilled water vodka and", "then some essential oils", "so I am adding vanilla and rose essential oil", "now you can add whatever essential oils you prefer whichever ones you have", "but vodka is actually used in several of the recipes in this book because it disinfects so that is why could use rubbing alcohol if you want", "but if you have vodka you can use vodka so that is why am gonna go ahead and spray a little bit of this on my couch", "so it smells nice and refreshed the next thing we are making", "is a carpet refresher which is also very very easy", "it is basically baking soda and essential oil", "so I have a little bowl of baking soda", "I am gonna add rose essential oil", "this is a pretty scent", "but again you could choose whichever one you want and basically you want to sift it onto your carpet and then vacuum it up", "and you can use this on any carpeted area", "a lot of times carpet refreshers things like this that are sold in the stores have other chemicals inside of them that are just really strong and overly fragrant", "so if you use a little tiny bit of essential oil you could use lemon or orange or whichever one", "you like it is a lot better of an option than some of the things that you can buy in the store and it does work for refreshing your carpet next", "I am going to share a few natural laundry alternatives starting with soap nuts in a muslin bag now these can be thrown into the wash in place of regular laundry detergent", "and they can be used up to six to eight times before you discard them", "it is recommended to use these with a laundry booster and also a fabric softener", "so that is why can replace basically your laundry detergent with those and use it up to six to eight times the other thing", "is dryer balls", "these are reusable and help reduce static and lint and also decrease the drying time in general it is a great non toxic replacement to a lot of dryer sheets which have cents and so basically you are gonna put a few essential oil drops on top of them", "and it works great once a week or every few weeks I do like to clean our toothbrushes", "and I use hydrogen peroxide for that", "so that is why just put a little bit of hydrogen peroxide into a container and put our toothbrushes inside of there and", "just let that soak for about 15 to 20 minutes", "and then I rinse it with water and they are good to go super easy and works great for cleaning toothbrushes", "you need a few ingredients to make a DIY all purpose cleanser", "I recommend getting a glass container because when you are using essential oils you do not want to use plastic you want to use glass so that is why can find them on Amazon", "I also order them on", "I get them in my grow of collaborative boxes", "I do like the ones from The Grove collaborative because they have silicone on the bottom", "so it is a little bit of a better grip", "but basically I filled the container 3 4 of the way with distilled water vodka the rest of the way", "and then I am adding my essential oils as always you can use essential oils that you prefer and that makes for a easy DIY all purpose cleanser next", "I am making a DIY natural surface scrub this is great for sinks bathtubs basically I am using baking soda", "I have a little bit of castile soap hydrogen peroxide and essential oils", "and then I have my walnut scrubbers", "I get those for free in my Grove box", "every month I used tea tree oil and lavender for this I am going to give it a good mix", "and then you want to put that paste on anything that needs a good scrub in your bathroom shower bath sink pretty much anywhere that you could think would need a nice good scrub a dub", "so that is what I am gonna use this for this", "is really great", "and I am gonna use my walnut sponges which have a on the one side", "it is abrasive so that works perfect with this", "you can make a easy DIY all purpose disinfectant with distilled water and vodka", "so again vodka is in a lot of these recipes because alcohol does index", "so basically I am gonna", "put distilled water and vodka", "and you mix that together you can spray it on your phone or anything that you really you know want to disinfect", "I also recommend using microfiber cloths I have so many different microfiber cloths for cleaning all over my house", "and I usually have different colors", "so I know certain my microfiber cloths I use in my bathroom others I use in my kitchen", "and so those are a few DIY options that I found in this book and wanted to share I love it", "I highly recommend picking up that book it gives so many more

moves because I am I will", "I ca", "not the flexibility is insanity you", "so I was also planning to recreate the green smoothie I had at that really great spot we both liked so", "that is why recreated it at home", "it is basically banana kale spinach romaine", "and then I used it ghave", "but you can do stevia or honey and then oat milk which oat milk", "has a really lovely flavor", "and I like this green smoothie to me", "it is", "like not it has a good flavor for a green smoothie I do not always like green smoothies", "so that is why wanted to make this one for all three of us", "so

usually that time of the month", "these are kind of the things that I like to do so", "starting with the first thing Kerbal tea", "I have always been a fan of herbal tea I have a tea station in my studio in my music room", "but", "I also have tons of teas in my kitchen one that I really like when I am feeling overwhelmed or in a funk or that time of the month is the stress relief honey lavender yogi tea", "I also have a custom blend that I make from a great herbal shop I visit in the San Fernando Valley", "and if you follow my blog I recently shared that", "and I will have the recipe over there as well for the pms relief tea", "but I will do custom blends as well if I do not find something from the store", "the next thing is a light stretching routine I am no yoga expert", "but I do try to stretch and", "since I workout on most days I d say five days a week I try to go to a boot camp class or do an at home workout I do stretch when I am on my period", "and I am feeling uncomfortable", "I try to stretch just to relieve any tension or discomfort in my lower abdomen right here I am doing a light and easy stretching routine ozzie", "is right there to support as always and it was pretty windy", "but it was a warm day", "so that is why decided to do", "this one outside cramps are absolutely no fun", "and I know they affect people to different degrees", "I personally did not start getting really bad ones until after I had my first son", "and I would get them", "but they were never as painful and for me", "it just feels like the lower half of my body is throbbing one thing that can be helpful for cramps is", "magnesium magnesium in general is very relaxing to the muscles of course you always want to talk to your doctor before you take a supplement internally but you can make a magnesium lotion bar which is believed to kind of relax the muscles when you are feeling crappy now some of these products depending on where you live might be kind of hard to come by but Amazon does sell magnesium oil", "I will have the ingredients listed below I have made several lotion bars on my channel before and basically over a double boiler I mixed together ingredients I always add essential oils once I have pulled that off", "and it is had a chance to cool down", "and then I put that into silicone molds and you could stick it in the refrigerator", "keep it at room temperature but", "basically you want to allow it to harden", "and then you have a lotion bar", "so that is why am just gonna put a little bit of this on my lower abdomen for some relief of cramping", "so this one is relatively easy to make all you need is a sock", "preferably a brand new one or at least a clean sock", "and I am using some rice here", "and I am gonna put some rice inside the sock", "I am gonna fill it up about 3 4 of the way", "then I am gonna add some lavender oil", "and I happen to have some dried lavender as well", "but that is totally optional if you have it", "I love dried herbs", "and I always have dried herbs around the house for different teas that I make and remedies and different things", "but in this case I am gonna put a little bit of dried lavender and essential oil", "I am going to tie it", "and then what you can do with this is you can stick it in the microwave for about ten to thirty seconds depending on the wattage of your microwave now keep in mind", "this can be a fire hazard", "so that is why want to keep your eyes very closely on anything like this that you put in the microwave", "but essentially you are gonna warm it up", "put it on your lower abdomen and hopefully it can relieve your cramping now if you do not want to make one yourself you can go to the drugstore and usually at the drugstore or even on Amazon they have these like beaded heating pads that you can stick in the microwave same type of thing ten to thirty seconds it will usually say on there depending on the wattage of your microwave", "work great and yes heating pads are amazing when your lower abdomen is feeling like it is going to fall out if I am in a funk or", "I am not feeling very well", "I love to do a little self care that is what this channel is all about", "so I pulled out a few stress relief products which usually when you see anything that says stress relief it is basically saying it is gonna be calming so it is gonna reduce redness or puffiness", "it is actually true that our skin changes around this time of the month so that is why can try reaching for products that are more stress relief or calming based and that will reduce any redness or puffiness so oftentimes when you are on your period you are gonna want high highly salty foods or sweet foods a lot of times not always", "but sometimes you will find that that is kind of what you are going for", "and I like to try to plan to make something hearty and healthy", "it definitely makes me feel better and on this day it was cold", "plus I was not feeling good", "so that is why decided to make a lentil kale soup", "so that is why have lentils carrots", "veggie broth", "I am gonna add some onions I like to add lots and lots of lemon", "I like it", "spicy", "i will personally add spice to mine after the fact because my son likes to have this obviously", "this is a dinner for everyone so that is why keep it mild", "and then I added some rosemary from the garden we have so much rosemary", "so I am always using it in everything", "and I just stick it in a crock pot I kept it on", "and it was done by dinner so that is why put it", "I d say like mid morning", "and then it was ready to go by dinner", "so obviously this recipe is great for whenever you are in the mood for it", "I love lentil kale soup but these ingredients are actually supposed to be very beneficial for when you are on your period", "so that is why would highly recommend having this plus even if it is a cold day or", "you are feeling off it is a yummy recipe", "and it is good for you", "it has lots of great ingredients so I am adding the chopped kale in once like about 15 minutes before you are ready to serve you", "are gonna add the kale in there", "I am gonna take the rosemary out", "and then I put it in a bowl and garnish it", "and it is absolutely delicious", "you should definitely try it out", "and I hope you enjoy last but certainly", "not least is a soothing bath", "now", "I know many people do not like to take baths while they are actually on their period but", "when you are PMSing and you are starting to feel the cramps coming and you are not feeling well a nice hot bath can be soothing", "you can make your own bath salts with Epsom salt and essential oils peppermint and lavender are two great ones to mix together for when you are getting ready to start your period", "so that is why highly recommend taking a nice warm bath another thing that I recommend for pain and discomfort in general is looking into CBD products CBD bath bombs", "I have been talking a lot more about CBD", "and I share my thoughts and my knowledge about it on my blog", "but I will also be carrying CBD products in my e commerce shop that I am launching at the end of this month if you are curious", "and you want to know more about the shop you can find this at Pacific time comm time", "is spelt like the herb you can sign up for a newsletter and you will get first notifications on when we launch new products and also coupon codes or you can find us on Instagram at Pacific time we will be carrying tons of different things", "but we will also have CBD products in the shop which even if you do not purchase CBD products from us I highly recommend looking into them because honestly they are such a natural relief for pain and discomfort", "and I am excited that more and more people are becoming aware that completes this video and some of my tips and tricks for around that time of the month or even when you are in a funk I hope that this video gave you some ideas and a few things

today I am whipping up a few recipes that are yummy", "they are I would call them more like finger foods", "they are not necessarily all healthy cuz we do have some fried options in here my oven broke this week that I filmed this", "so I went for some fried options so these are finger foods like plant based finger foods and everything in moderation", "they are all vegetarian", "they are all vegan", "so let is jump right in they", "are all delicious let is start with the first one artichoke quesadilla so good they can be made completely plant based or you can make it with whatever you have in your refrigerator meaning if you have regular cream cheese you could go with that", "but in this case I have vegan cream cheese I am starting off by chopping up some garlic I am adding a little bit of olive oil", "okay", "so next I am adding to the pan some marinated artichoke hearts you could use fresh artichoke hearts if you want or make them yourself some marinated artichoke hearts that is a little bit more work obviously so you can grab the marinated ones from the store I am adding about 3 cups of baby spinach and then about 4 ounces of cream cheese in this case", "I have a vegan cream cheese", "but you could certainly use regular cream cheese", "and then I am also adding some vegan ease", "I would adjust the recipes I would not use regular mayonnaise but the vegan mayonnaise is a little bit more citrusy", "it is really light so that is why actually prefer vegan mayonnaise over traditional mayonnaise", "so I am adding that into the saut\u00e9 pan along with salt pepper and red pepper flakes so I am heating up some tortillas", "and then I am going to add the mixture into the center of them and continue to cook them till they are ready to go", "and these are pretty quick and easy to whip up and they are good", "so that is why are definitely decadent especially even for being a plant based recipe but", "it is pretty good", "I am also putting some fresh spinach in there as well", "and then they are ready to go so", "next this is the first time I have actually ever made a samosa they turned out beautiful", "and I want to make them again", "so this is not my recipe", "but I did want to share", "and I will link below where I got this recipe and also I will link the recipe as well so that is why am basically adding several different spices garam masala smoked paprika curry powder", "I am adding that with olive oil so that is why have about 2 tablespoons of olive oil here", "so I have a wooden spoon here", "and essentially what I am doing is infusing the spices into the oil mixing them together", "I love the aroma that it gives off", "it is just such a beautiful scent and all those spices mixed together so lovely", "and then I have some chopped potatoes I have some chopped onions", "chopped bell peppers I have a little red onion some carrots so that is why am gonna mix that all in there and continue to saute until it is nice and soft and the potatoes are edible and this also makes a really great side for breakfast if that is something that you want to try for breakfast instead", "but in this case I am going to take this", "and it is gonna be a stuffing for the wontons", "I absolutely love fresh ginger", "so I am grading about one tablespoon of fresh ginger into the mix and it is it is", "I mean ginger has so many health benefits", "but I love it for tea", "I love it in every type of food I feel like it is just one of those amazing beneficial foods to get into your system", "so that is why am adding plenty of ginger", "and again I am just gonna let that saute until those potatoes are nice and soft now if you follow my husband", "is", "Cooking Channel", "you know that he would make these wonton wrappers from scratch", "but this is my channel", "and I got this from the store just making things a little bit faster because making things homemade can be such a beautiful process but time consuming so if you do not have the time you can pick up the wonton wrappers from the store I am stuffing the middle of these and", "essentially I understood because I could have had way more of the filling in there since this was my first time making it", "I wanted to", "I had plenty of room", "so that is why did not over stuff", "but I definitely could added some more so that is why am adding a little bit of water that helps it the wontons to kind of stick to themselves", "and I am folding them over", "and then I am going to fry them", "I know frying is scary but my oven was broken", "if your oven is not broken and you would rather cook them in the oven you can certainly do that I will have all the info below on how you can do that", "but in this case we just fried him up you know for an occasional finger food treat", "they were pretty amazing so on the wonton wrapper", "it will actually give you an ideal temperature for frying them so that is why am using my little handy dandy laser thermometer definitely a benefit of being married to a chef", "is the cool gadgets that helped me out a great deal", "so these wontons I am just gonna flip them over I d say about 10 to 20 seconds on each side you want to keep a close eye on them because as the oil gets hot they can burn fast so that is why am gonna pull those out and let them kind of harden up", "and then you have this really beautiful crispy outside with a yummy inside it", "is warm and cozy definitely a recipe worth trying whether you bake them or fry them", "pot stickers were so the jam growing up", "we had them all the time when we came home from school", "so today I am making veggie pot stickers I am starting out with some diced onion", "and then I have a little bit of diced green onion as well all right next", "I am adding my favorite fresh ginger", "I am very generous with the ginger because I love it", "and I feel like it adds a lot of flavor to these pot stickers", "so ginger all the way then I am chopping up some mushrooms", "did you know mushrooms are the vegetarian or vegan option that gives you vitamin D", "we can give vitamin D from the Sun and other sources as well but mushrooms are the vegetarian food that can make vitamin D thought I d let you know cabbage putting some cabbage in there", "and I am gonna saute that up get that nice and soft I have some chopped up green onion and also some grated carrots", "so I am gonna add that to the mixture as well and continue to stir", "until it is all really well incorporated one thing I also added that I forgot to show here is lime", "and I felt like the balance of acidity it can feel a little heavy with pop stickers but then with the ginger and the lime it elevates the flavor for me so that is why added about 2 limes little salt and pepper", "and then I am gonna put this into a bowl", "let it cool down once it is had a chance to cool down", "I am going to put it in the center of wontons and make my pot stickers I coded the bottom of a saute pan with a little bit of olive oil", "and then I am going to add the potstickers and just basically gently sear the bottom of them", "and then I am gonna add water", "put a top on and then let them steam the rest of them", "so the dip I have some soy sauce a little bit of rice vinegar and then a entire lime again love", "the lime makes a really good dip for these", "and these are a real crowd pleaser kids", "love them great for parties or events or even you can freeze them make them later if you want to make some homemade pot stickers or pina semi homemade", "these are a great option or you can pick up pot stickers from Trader Joe", "is", "but I do not know if they have the de Tyrion ones", "so these were super delicious a must try for sure", "all right so that completes these yummy finger foods", "hopefully you

thirty minutes I set a timer", "and I go and do not stop or", "hopefully that is the goal", "is that you do not stop and you clean so that is why start by organizing and getting everything in its place", "and then I clean as much as I can", "and I try to get to the floors and whatever the room is so for instance", "right now I am doing the kitchen", "the kitchen was not crazy messy", "but I had 20 minutes to get it as clean as possible", "so that is why moved things around cleaned on the counters I did a load of dishes", "and I tried to get it as clean as possible and then", "I also went

happy with it", "and I went as much as I could for 20 minutes", "and then I was done", "I almost never clean the whole house in one day I seemed to clean in segments", "so I clean the rooms whenever

that when he was away at school", "so that is why set a timer again and went for it and that is the same for Isaiah", "is room the guest room and my bedroom my bathroom all that", "so setting a timer

the timeframe that I choose", "so I highly recommend trying that out one thing I definitely want to be better about this year", "is to simplify my routine my cleaning routine and also just the amount of products that I use and one way that I have been doing that is by experimenting with concentrates so this is the seventh generation laundry detergent concentrate", "and it has 66 loads in that smaller bottle", "so it is hopefully less waste in the long run", "I also ordered the concentrates from The Grove collaborative when I saw those on the site", "I knew I wanted to try those out", "and I knew I would love them so that is why got the glass cleaner", "and I got the all purpose cleaner", "and they basically come in these little small squeeze bottles so that is why ordered the reusable glass bottle with the silicone around it", "and you take the concentrate you squeeze it into that bottle", "fill the rest up with water", "give it a nice little shake and then for the all purpose one you can use it everywhere", "I used it in my bathroom for my bathtub and also for my floors with my steam mop", "I also want to note that the smell of this is extremely pleasant because it is essential oils and not artificial fragrances", "so it is not gonna give you a headache", "I get a microfiber cloth probably every other order so every other month", "and I clean the floors with the all purpose cleanser with my steam mop", "and then I use the microfiber cloth to clean the bathtub", "and it smelled so lovely and subtle", "and it was just really beautiful so that segues me perfectly into less harsh chemicals and strong fragrances", "this last holiday season we all got the flu and there was lots of disinfecting products around the house", "and I felt like they were strong", "and it was irritating our respiratory systems just to be using that so that is why ordered the seventh generation collection the disinfecting counter spray and also the spray which is perfectly safe to use on kids toys", "it said right on there that it is meant for that it is made with essential oils and much more natural ingredients it is not overpowering in its scent", "it is not nauseating", "you can use it all over and especially for flu season just having around I feel like", "is beneficial so anyway those are kind of my goals for the next year", "is to keep it simple less

video is all about our doggy", "Ozzie", "but I am gonna be making a bunch of DIYs so if you are a dog lover and you have dogs", "maybe there is a few things in here you can make for your dog", "we get so bonded with our pets and want to take care of them and love on them the way that they love us and so that is why wanted to make a few things for him because we are a bit obsessed with him he brings so much happiness and joy to our lives and our family", "but before I jump into the DIYs I wanted to share with you guys a little footage on the day we picked him up from the shelter I felt so bad for him the day we went to pick him up", "and I kept trying to reassure him that we were gonna take such good care of him and treat him", "so well he is a border collie Labrador mix", "and he is honestly been the perfect fit for our family he is so fun and playful with Oliver gentle with the baby", "and you know he has his ways", "but he is such a love and so perfect for our family yes", "so let is get to spoiling our dogs first thing first", "I am making him some breath cookies because this dog has some kick in breath and some kickin gas", "but I am not gonna get into that", "let is stick with the breath right now", "so that is why am adding some ingredients to a food processor", "I am gonna have all the ingredients listed below basically it is like oatmeal a little bit of parsley and mint", "you do not want to feed them too much from my research", "but like a little bit is okay", "I have some yogurt", "and I am gonna put also a little bit of coconut oil in there", "so I will have the ratios below but he loved these", "and I did find that they really did help with his breath", "the thing is that you have to make them and store them in the refrigerator for they last for maybe like three days three to five days", "max", "and then you want to make a new batch", "I added a little bit of water to make it from a dry to a more wet consistency kind of like a cookie dough", "and I am gonna put small balls on a baking sheet", "and I am gonna bake these in the oven for about 15 to 18 minutes", "you just want to keep an eye on them once they start to brown", "you want to pull them out right away", "and then you can just leave him out to cool down", "I stick them in a bag and then put them in the refrigerator", "Ozzy was on standby the entire time waiting for them to finish and when they did finish", "I gave him one", "so I think one or two max", "and then you can wait till the next day to give them another one", "but it does seem to help", "and he does like them", "so that is why think I will 100 be making these again", "so I wanted to make an O so doggie bed my concern with this particular DIY was was he going to destroy the bed or not", "and I will get into that in a second", "so I am cutting strips I have basically some fabric that I got on clearance at Target", "I think it was three to five dollars", "and I think this particular fabric was actually a curtain so that is why am cutting slits", "and then I am gonna tie them all together and leave a small space open to stuff it now if you have a mischievous dog who will either bite or pull these apart", "you may not want to go for this", "but if you have a chill dog that will lay down on it and not try to pull the whole thing apart I would definitely try the no sew doggie bed it lasted for a lot longer than I thought it would and since it was a few dollars I already had the stuffing from a previous DIY", "I did a cloud", "I think was like a cloud light back at the old house in Oliver", "is room so that is why happen to have it", "so I wanted to experiment with this one so you are taking those two sections you are tying them in a double knot all the way around filling it with stuffing and then continuing to tie until it is completely tied all around the entire thing and if your dog is pretty chill or a cat this could work for a cat too then", "and they wo not destroy it", "I would highly recommend it", "I think it is easy to do", "and it is you can make it fairly inexpensive as well especially since dog beds can be pricey", "so next we are making a DIY dog toy", "this is kind of similar to one of those rope ball toys that you can find at the pet shop", "basically all you are going to need is an old tennis ball and an old shirt", "so I am using this old shirt here", "and I am just cutting it into two sections so that is why am cutting the sides", "and then I am gonna cut the top", "so where the shoulders go", "I am gonna cut that off so that I have two pieces of fabric next I am going to cut those pieces into strips I am taking one of Ozzy", "is tennis balls and", "I am just going to put a hole all the way through it", "and then I am going to take the strip", "is and insert them through both holes so that they come out on each side", "I did happen to borrow my husband", "is", "kitchen tweezers do not tell I was having a little bit of a hard time", "so if you can find some sort of device to help you push the strip is through the ball", "it is very helpful so that is why ended up only being able to insert about three because that was all the room I had with what I had made the hole that I made", "and then I am braiding those together so that I have a DIY rope toy next", "I am gonna make some DIY paw balm now the other day I was noticing that the bottom of his paws looked a little dry", "and I feel like he deserves some pampering hey", "my kids and my dog deserve some pampering so that is why am actually gonna make a DIY paw balm", "I am gonna add a few popular ingredients I usually use shea butter coconut oil a little bit of vitamin E and a little bit of olive oil", "and I am gonna make a bomb", "and you can use this for the bottom of their feet when it gets trife if you notice on my channel", "anytime I make a bomb or a lotion or even like a whipped body cream I always start first with my version of a double boiler which is basically a stainless steel bowl placed on top of a pan that has a little bit of boiling water at the bottom so it is steaming it from the bottom I place my oils or my shea butter together so that they can melt together with an oil like vitamin E", "I usually do not heat that up", "I add that after once the oil has had a chance to cool down", "and I put that in a container and let it go room temperature", "and it will Harden", "and then you can use this on yourself you can use it on your kids", "and you can also use it on your dog", "so I use it at the for the bottom of his paw as much as he will let me do it but just to avoid any cracked or dry paws and cause he gets a little spa treatment", "next I am making a DIY dog bowl tray so that is why am using an old cutting board that was warped and basically was just sitting in our garage", "I did not have the heart to throw it away because it is a bows cutting board booze bows", "and it is one of my husband", "is and", "it was just warped completely dried out cracking breaking", "so basically it was actually broken in half as you can see here this bowl that I have has a lip on the top", "so I am tracing the bottom part of the bowl so that I can place the bowl inside of the hole that I make and it will fit and not fall through", "I grabbed the largest drill bit that we had and made my first initial hole in the middle of my tray circle", "then I took a jigsaw first time using a jigsaw", "this is a Devo", "and I am creating the circle and just trying to follow the line that I traced as best as possible it was a little bit difficult because honestly I ran into the problem of the wood dust wood", "block my view from being able to accurately go on my traced line so that is why feel like with this I had to stop and blow away the wood dust and then continue on", "but I will say with this particular project", "you do not have to have a perfect circle if it is not super clean", "the bowl is gonna hide a lot of that so for my first time I feel like I did better than what I expected with the jigsaw", "but my circle definitely was not perfect next", "I am testing to see if the bowls fit which they do", "and then I am going to add the legs onto the bottom", "I have four galvanized flanges that I am gonna put on all four corners and", "I also have four galvanized pipes that I am going to screw into those flanges once I drill them in so next", "I am going to start drilling in the flanges into the board after I made the garden bed", "if you watch that video I actually upgraded our drill to addy Walt which has significantly more power", "and I have found it to be really helpful in all of our home projects thus far so that is why do highly recommend this drill", "so now I am going to screw the galvanized piping into those flanges", "and then I pretty much am finished at this point", "you do have the option of adding a piece to the bottom of the pipes", "but I got the wrong piece", "and so that is why have to go back to Home Depot to get those and", "if you follow me on Instagram and you follow my stories I will show that at some point when I get around to finishing that but for now this has actually worked", "really great it is been we have been using it for the last few weeks", "and it is a little bit better for Ozzy", "is neck when he is eating his food and it was totally and completely oz approved", "and I love that it is an old bows or booze cutting board because it kind of represents", "you know I do not know he is a cool chef dog", "right", "so anyway I remade this", "I up cycled a old cutting board and made this 4 oz", "and I think it turned out all things considering pretty good", "so anyway that completes my doggy DIYs", "I hope you enjoyed this video", "and

organized for me that is kind of where I start", "and then over time you know you invest in a home and then over the years you change things up", "and you make it more customized to your preference", "and but for now I feel like organizing makes a huge difference and", "it does make me so much happier so that is why like these organizers because it makes it look like it is a little bit more pulled together instead of everything thrown in the drawers and for me I can sleep a little bit better at night when things are organized and if you watch my channel you probably know that about me although everything is not always organized at all times it", "it makes me feel good when it is I gotta say so just cleaning everything up", "and then I am gonna do the same thing basically for the cabinet you can get cool boxes and organizers again for really affordable either on sale at places like Hobby Lobby they always have sales there 50 off 75 off pretty much always", "and you can also find them at Target for pretty good deals and if you keep coupons you can get cool bins and so basically I always come in and take everything out", "I clean the area I then donate or throw away whatever I do not

beds", "and I knew I wanted the garden bed to be a little bit larger", "and we were originally going for a large square bed so that is why started by cutting the wood pieces now the large wood pieces

pieces of wood", "and I cut 18 inch posts for the inside so these really large pieces of wood these were cut already from Home Depot", "this is Shane", "he is gonna be helping me with this project

bit of a challenge especially with the shape we ended up choosing so right here", "I am basically drilling holes and", "then we together went back and forth drilling the screws into the four corners

realized hmm maybe our measurements are off because this is a little large", "I am not gonna be able to reach into the middle if I want to garden unless I put a large tree in the middle which was not really what we were going for", "so after seeing that we felt the bed was a little bit larger than what we wanted we decided to troubleshoot we thought of a few different ideas and we ended up landing and rethinking our shape of the bed and creating au bed which was gonna be a little bit more challenging because we had to get a few more pieces of wood and adjust our measurements now I will have all the measurements listed below along with our diagram", "but I do want to let you know neither of us knew what we were doing this was our first time doing this", "so this was more of documenting the process and kind of sharing with you how it went down not necessarily a tutorial because it is hard to react splain how we did this but", "what we are doing here is basically drilling the posts into the new pieces of wood with our new measurements so we cut the long piece of wood we originally had on the one side", "and now we have a u shape we had to dig some holes push it into the ground and make sure it was level", "so there was a lot that went on here in the sense that we wanted to all the holes", "were the same depth and that when we put the garden bed in there it was level", "so we just used a leveler to", "even though it took several days to figure this out I ended up loving the u shape", "I think it is gonna be fun to have a garden in that garden bed", "the next thing that I had to do was lay down mesh because we do have a little bit of a gopher problem and", "the Gophers like to dig under and eat from the roots so if you do not have something under there", "they will destroy your garden and that is kind of the tricky thing with farming or gardening and as we are barely starting we are realizing it is very hard to have an organic garden with all the pests and bugs

out pretty cool", "and I like the shape", "so next I had to fill the garden bed up with some soil and we happen to have some organic soil and a garden bed that we were not using on the other side of our property so that is why moved that with a wheelbarrow over here I have some more soil that we put on that I did not film yet", "and we are also prepping the soil right now", "we actually have not even started planting anything yet there is not much we can plant right now maybe some garlic some kale besides prepping the soil", "the next thing that I am gonna do is seedlings", "so maybe that is

continued to drink it in the morning with my green tea", "so that is why add the two of those together", "and then I add some hot water I usually do not sweeten my tea or anything like that", "I love the earthy flavor so that is why will usually drink this before I head out to work out if I am heading to work out", "or I am just chillin with my kids", "I usually put a ball cap on to be honest", "but I have curly hair and that means a lot of knots", "so what I do is if I am taking a shower in the morning which I actually usually take showers at night", "but if I do take a shower in the morning I have been using this coconut water shampoo and conditioner to be honest", "I go back and forth between this one which is my drugstore choice and my alterna caviar which is expensive and sometimes I do not want to drop that kind of cash on shampoo and conditioner", "so this is my second favorite from the drugstore", "and then I do try to take a comb and get rid of any knots", "well I have the conditioner in my hair", "I know that a lot of people say you should not brush your hair or use a comb in the shower or when your hair is wet", "but I find that it does help with my knots and getting them out", "I have a collection of a few different oils that I like for my body for my face and for my hair", "so I picked out some macadamia nut oil for my hair because I find that it makes my hair shiny", "but it does not weigh it down if I do take a shower and do my hair in the daytime", "I usually will blow it straight with a paddle brush I start with my hands and blow it going down",

touch up the one I have on hand right now", "is by tarte", "and i actually really like it i have tried several and this one smells good", "it is pretty lightweight", "another thing that i discovered

have tried every hairstyle", "and I feel like every hairstyle is high maintenance in its own way", "but with the long hair I have kind of figured out what works and like the few styles and products

usually blow it out", "like this keep it pretty simple", "and then the other hairstyle that I have been liking to do lately with long hair", "especially so I start with some of it up and some of it down and that is if I am gonna do a high pony", "and then I basically tie my hair in one inch sections and", "I will either do it like that where it is higher up on my head", "or I will do a side pony if I wear my hair in a bun", "I like to wear it in the day", "but if I do keep it at night and fall asleep with my hair in a bun I will have a lot of knots in the morning", "so this hairstyle is good for preventing that", "and if I am looking for something casual but cute and pretty simple depending on the day and what I have planned sometimes I take a shower in the daytime but a lot of times I take it at night after my kids go to sleep so if I did not have my collagen in the morning which I usually do I will use the beauty water which is their lavender and lemon flavor", "and I add it to some hot water and drink that", "and then I take a shower", "and I wash my hair as normal", "and then when I get out I use my macadamia nut oil on my damp hair", "and then I put my hair in two braids

to do something with chalk for Oliver", "is room as well", "and he was actually curious as to what I was doing", "so that is why had a wood board that I bought at Home Depot the length and width that I was going for for the chalkboard", "and then I took some chalkboard paint", "this is the chalkboard paint that you can use to paint the wall so you can actually paint an entire side of your wall chalkboard", "but I just decided to use a wood board and we were outside in a well ventilated area in my garage with the doors open", "so just when you are using this that if you are painting the side of a wall or you are in a room", "it is well ventilated or you take the project outside like for this one I am just painting a board this particular paint is generally used in kids rooms", "so it had no scent", "it did not have any fumes or anything", "but I did leave it out", "and I did not end up hanging it in my son", "is room for about a week after just to", "it was completely dry", "so I am gonna frame this", "and I have some leftover wood from when I did the DIY garment ladder for my bathroom that was the first video where I started to experiment with woodworking and now that I have a miter saw I have been doing a little bit more and also working with my angles", "so that is why have 45 degree angles here to create a frame for around the chalkboard the width of my chalkboard", "is 18 inches and the height is 45 inches", "so what I am doing here is I am creating my measurements and I am taking a pencil and marking it", "and then when I use my miter saw I try to get as close to the pencil marking as possible and the way that I do that", "is", "I come down a little bit", "and I check how close it is to my pencil marking", "I move the wood a tiny bit over if I have not quite met the mark and usually I can get it right on target", "so that is why it fits really well", "and so that is why had to work with this", "was a little bit of a challenge", "but I have been enjoying working with the miter", "saw you want to", "if you are gonna use a miter saw and you are not gonna get your wood cut for you that you are paying attention to obviously wearing goggles and all the safety precautions when using something like this it is actually pretty fun to use once you feel comfortable", "and you also feel safe so that is why will put a video down below that I watched when I started using my miter", "saw the next thing that I am doing is using a little bit of gorilla glue to temporarily glue the pieces onto the chalkboard", "so this is not gonna be the way that the wood is held to the chalkboard I am gonna screw it in from the other side but for now just to hold it in place", "I have these clamps", "and I am gonna put my frame in place so once the frame was fit to the chalkboard I used the clamps and allowed it to dry overnight completely so it was completely dry", "then I removed the clamps I turned the chalkboard over", "and then I am using a total of eight screws to", "I screw the chalkboard into the wood so your screws should be short enough that they connect the pieces of wood but do not go all the way through to come back out the front", "so that is what I am doing here as I am screwing those in I", "have two hanging brackets that I am going to screw into the top back of the board and that is what I am gonna use to hang it on the wall next", "I am measuring the length of the wall that I plan to hang my frame on", "and I am gonna find the center I am gonna measure how far apart the brackets were from each other and then use the center point of the wall to determine how far apart the holes would need to be placed", "so I make my markings", "and I use my drill to create two pilot holes", "then I am gonna hammer in anchors for added support because it is kind of a heavier piece", "so I want to it stays", "and then I am gonna drill in screws with a little left out so that the brackets have something to hold on to I like this for kids rooms", "but you can really use it anywhere in the house for a baby room you can put nap times or feeding schedules for older kids", "it is great for soccer practice reminder or ballet class or karate", "or wherever your kids are going it is kind of fun maybe good for homework or schoolwork reminders you can use it in the kitchen for menus or in the bathroom kind of wherever you think it would work in your house", "I wanted to try to experiment with making frames so that is why can continue to make frames for around my home", "so what I am doing here is making a frame for my son", "is room", "and I have thinner pieces of wood here", "but I am using the same method that I used when creating the frame for the chalkboard so even though the wood is thinner basically what I did is I created my markings for how tall and how wide I want the frame to be", "I cut them at 45 degree angles and then here I have the finish to frame so what I am gonna do is I am actually gonna stain", "I had a little tiny bit left of the stain that I have used in previous video so that is why am actually finishing that up", "so that is why am gonna have a dark wood frame", "but you could paint it black or white or keep it the color that it is it", "kind of just depends on how your house looks and what you are going for after that has had a chance to completely dry I am using elbow brackets and that basically allows the frame to stay together so that is why am screwing in screws and using my elbow brackets on all of the corners and", "then that finishes up the frame for the inside of the frame", "what I did was", "I collected some sticks from outside my dog and my son are always running around with sticks", "so I just decided to collect a few small sticks I am going to put those sticks in the shape of an eye so that it looks like an eye for Isaiah and it is the sticks from the backyard and the sticks that his brother and dog play with", "I do not know", "I thought it was kind of fun for now", "and then maybe in the future I am just gonna put a regular old picture in the frame", "but I thought I d be creative", "I took some cardboard that happened to be the right height and length that I was looking for so", "that is why just decided to recycle that I painted it with the chalkboard paint a because I wanted to use the rest of the check board paint I am not using this as a chalkboard but black happened to look good now with most letters I would recommend having some sort of stencils so that it is a little bit easier but", "right here I am gluing I am gonna try to create an eye as best as possible with my own eye get it with my own eye", "I am gonna try to create an eye", "but basically I am stacking the sticks until it looked like an eye it really ended up looking like a tree trunk to me and kind of like an eye", "but I feel like", "was pretty cool", "and I went ahead and hung it in my son", "is room", "I made sure that I was in a well ventilated area again and also that this had a chance to really dry", "so that is why ended up not hanging it up for about a week after but", "what I did here was I took the cardboard", "and I took a staple gun", "and I stapled all the way around the frame I want to experiment in the future a little bit more with frames", "but this is what I decided to do I wanted to be creative and try something out", "and this is kind of what came out of it", "so it looks like a little bit of a tree trunk", "I am not sure how long it will last in the room", "I might switch it up or change it or put something else in there",

or hobby lobby these ones are fun and", "you do not even actually have to hang it up or screw it in", "they have these great command tabs which are nice for lighter weight wood pieces that you want to hang in your kids rooms or in your room and basically it hangs to the wall", "and it does not create any leftover residue when you remove the piece", "so that is why use those a lot around our house

half teaspoons of beeswax and two teaspoons of coconut oil one teaspoon of cocoa butter and one tablespoon of pumpkin seed oil", "now I am adding this to a double boiler or in my case I am using a

incorporated you are going to pull that off of the heat you are gonna let it cool down for a little bit", "and then you are gonna add a dash of vitamin E oil some cinnamon essential oil clove essential oil", "and then I am adding a dash of pumpkin spice I have an old spice container that I just washed out", "and I am gonna recycle", "and I am gonna put the melted ingredients inside of that

ounce foaming soap dispenser which you can find at Target", "then I have 1 4 of a cup of unscented liquid castile soap", "I am adding 1 tablespoon of vegetable glycerin and 1 tablespoon of either

drops of cedar wood", "six drops of wild orange essential oil and six drops of rosemary essential oil", "but I am mixing this together", "and then I am gonna fill the rest with water so you can add a little bit when it comes time to washing your hands", "it will foam up and make a nice hand wash next", "I am making some pumpkin spice whipped body butter", "it is pretty easy to make I have made

minutes I am gonna add a little bit of pumpkin pie spice and some vitamin E oil and then a little tiny bit of vanilla extract", "so that is why think I added about one teaspoon of vanilla extract and about two teaspoons of vitamin E oil or capsules if you happen to have capsules", "so that is why am gonna mix that together", "and then I am gonna allow that to solidify now you can make lotion bars", "but you can also whip it with a KitchenAid so or a hand mixer", "so that is why am adding the entire solidified lotion bar to my mixer", "and I am gonna mix it on high now the more air you put into it", "the more fluffy it is going to be", "you can make it a lotion or a body butter or you can treat it like a lotion bar and just warm it in your hand and use it on your skin and that leads me to the next recipe that we are going to be making which is a vanilla lotion", "bars these vanilla bean lotion bars are really easy to make all you need is cocoa butter two tablespoons of coconut oil

is completely melted you can add it to molds and", "the fun thing is you can choose whichever molds you", "like", "so you can do heart molds or just whichever fun ones you can find I just happen to have some round half circle molds that I like", "so that is why am just gonna pour that into there and allow it to solidify", "and then you have lotion bars these are great to be kept in like Ziploc bags I like to keep them in the refrigerator so that is why stay really solid", "and then you warm them up between your hands you can use them on yourself", "I use them on Oliver 4 when he gets dry

gonna kind of garnish the tablescape with that", "and I got the candles from the dollar section at Target which I mentioned in my fall vibes video and then", "I also have like the smaller pumpkins

I decided to do chocolate apples", "and then I am gonna add a little bit of coconut oil that is gonna allow the chocolate to harden once you stick the apples in the refrigerator", "so they harden a little bit quicker around the Apple itself so that is why am adding about a tablespoon of coconut oil in with the vegan chocolate chips you can use regular chocolate chips if you prefer I have a makeshift double boiler here", "basically a pan with some water that is boiling", "and I have a bowl on top I am going to melt the chocolate and the coconut oil together", "and then I have apples that

of granola bars and I found this recipe while I was pinning on Amy is healthy baking calm", "it is great because it is basically coconut oil mixed with unsweetened applesauce", "and then a little bit of she said in her recipe to use regular milk I am using a alternative so that is why am using almond milk here", "and then we are adding some honey some cinnamon two and a half cups of old fashioned oats into that I had some frozen raspberries", "but if you have frozen strawberries or blueberries and you prefer that instead you can put that in there", "but the raspberry apples are really nice

little bit more if they are not sweet enough or less if you prefer", "and then you know they do not have any added coloring or anything like that great for snacks great for packing and zip locks

sweetness I am adding some honey", "and then I am going to add some unsalted butter and begin to mix adding one egg yolk at a time I am adding three egg yolks to the mix I am gonna add the flour a little bit at a time so that it has time to incorporate into the mixture before I add a little bit more", "I am kneading the dough into a ball", "then I am gonna flatten it into a disc and wrap it in

an apple pie type filling", "so that is why am taking these apples that have not quite gone bad yet", "but they are on their way they are a little grainy and those types of apples are perfect for this type of recipe", "I am gonna put that into a bowl and add some water and lemon juice", "I am gonna put that mixture into my saucepan", "and I am going to turn it on to low", "so it starts to simmer",

ahead and add that mixture into the apples that have already been cooking I am gonna cook that down until the apples are nice and mushy once I see that the apples are pretty soft", "I am gonna let those cool down a little bit they do not have to be cold", "but then I am gonna add them to a food processor and mix that till it is an applesauce consistency I am bringing my chilled out", "then I am gonna prepare my workspace with a little bit of flour", "and then I am gonna go ahead and roll out the dough", "be sure to knead the dough a little bit before you roll it out", "I made that mistake

version these tasted a lot like apple pie to me", "so it was like an apple pie type crust with the filling", "they were definitely very tasty", "but they did not turn out as perfect as the ones from

treatments on the weekends and", "although when I was younger they used to be longer", "I still like to make time to do it now that I am a little bit older and have kids", "so what I do is if I know I want to have a spa night I like to prep in the daytime and get things ready when I get a chance", "so one thing I am doing here is making infused water which if you have watched my channel before you know I have made several of these", "but I have never made a fall themed infused water", "so that is what we are doing today", "it is fall flavors we have thinly sliced pear apple and plum", "and then I am gonna add some cinnamon as well in there some cinnamon sticks", "and then I am gonna stick that in the refrigerator let those ingredients in to fuse into the water and then by time nighttime comes", "and I am ready to take my bath or my hot shower", "I have a really yummy infused water to cool me down if I get overheated and also this is something if you are not gonna do a spa day or a pamper day you can make it for around the house", "or if I get together or a party it is perfect in the fall months if you do not have a body scrub that you love you can make a pumpkin pie body scrub by adding some cane sugar brown sugar coconut oil vanilla and a little bit of pumpkin pie spice so if you are looking for something nice for the shower I usually do scrubs in the shower", "and this is a fall scrub that I would make if I did not have one on hand that I wanted to use next", "I like to set the vibe so if I know my bathroom is messy and there is brushes and hair blow dryers and clothes thrown everywhere", "and I want to have a spa night at the end of the day", "I will kind of clean it up and also in the fall winter months", "I like to kind of put a few little decorations so that it is pretty so that when I am taking a bath I can look around", "and it is clean and pretty", "so what I am doing here is I am just adding some flowers and some of those funky pumpkins that I had around the house I am moving my breast pump and getting all that out of the way my hairbrush and instead I am gonna put a diffuser some flowers and some really pretty white pumpkins to give it a nice feel which might seem over the top but do what you can in your bathroom when I lived in an apartment I just put a nice candle and some flowers in there", "and I d still go and give myself beauty treatments I did not care that I did not have a fancy bathroom I just tried to make it feel as comfy and cozy as possible and then with a diffuser you can mix essential oils to create different blends and make your bathroom smell super yummy so that is why am doing this in the day so that my bathroom smells yummy by time I get around to it at night", "so that is why would say I started doing this at around 4 30 or so", "and then I ended up taking my bath at like 8 o clock", "so it had several hours to make the bathroom smell good the next thing I like to do", "is pick out the products that I plan to use for my treatment so since I wanted to do a fall theme I decided to pick up some really fun bath bombs from lush", "I love their bath bombs because they have like this sparkly pumpkin", "and then they had a jack o lantern one", "so that is why ended up using the jack o lantern", "one for my son is bath and then for my own bath", "I decided to use the sparkly pumpkin", "and you will see that in a little bit so that is why picked up some bath bombs", "I also picked up the boom toothy tabs I will talk about those in a minute they are like charcoal tabs for brushing your teeth", "I am gonna use the glam glow bubble sheet mask some new exfoliating gloves I love these gloves", "these are the charcoal ones you can find them at Target", "so I start by cleansing my skin with the Clarisonic and whenever I am going to be doing a spa treatment I usually start with that because when you go to the spa that is what they use on you generally before you get a facial", "and then I am going to be using the glam glow bubble sheet mask first time ever using a bubble sheet mask in this video", "I had never tried one before and I happen to have this one lying around and my husband who bless his heart always films me doing this stuff", "was laughing at me in the background because my face looked crazy", "it definitely felt like my skin got a breath of fresh air if that makes any sense it was kind of an interesting feeling", "and then the boom tabs are really fun because they are like charcoal treatments for your teeth like toothpaste they taste like coca cola", "and they are", "they have a little bit of whitening", "as well you can find those at lush", "so that is why like to brush with those when I am doing treatments as well and those also make me look crazy once I finish a facial treatment something quick", "and I dry brush", "I usually like to put my bath bomb in the back", "and then once it is filled up", "I like to get inside and just enjoy and relax if you are taking a shower instead of a bath you can use your scrub and your gloves in the shower and take a hot shower and finish off with a cold shot or you can finish off your bath with a cold shot so that completes my fall spa night", "I hope you take time to treat yourself and relax", "and you found some ideas in this video that might help you do that", "so thanks so much for watching", "and I will see you guys

veggie chili", "and then some pumpkin Alfredo which may not be for everyone", "but it was yummy", "and it is a nice fall dish", "so let is start first with pumpkin muffins I am gonna start with dry ingredients and then wet ingredients and they are gonna be in separate bowls I will have all the ingredients listed below and everything that you will need I originally made my pumpkin muffins from a box that I got at Trader Joe", "is I wanted to make a vegan option", "so that is why am making this one here", "and this is gonna be the vegan and gluten free muffins so if you are interested in that recipe that is gonna be below or", "you can go pick up the box from Trader Joe", "is which was also really good so that is why made that one earlier in the week", "and if you follow me on instagram you will have seen that", "and then I remade this one a vegan version and that is the one that I am putting on my channel", "so that is why have the wet ingredients the dry ingredients I am gonna add the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whip it really good with a whisk", "we have some pumpkin puree in there", "and we have a little bit of vanilla bean which I get that the vanilla paste", "a lot of you ask me I get that", "on Amazon it is a big bottle of vanilla paste", "so that is why am mixing that together until it is well incorporated and then with the vegan and gluten free muffin", "you want to fill it to the top of the molds because they do not rise quite as much as the box version does", "the Box version at Trader Joe is you had to fill it about halfway into the mold", "these are the perfect dessert or a great morning treat and the vegan gluten free are a little bit more dense than the Trader Joe is version", "but they were still really good you can leave them plain or you can put some sugar and cinnamon on top", "I did not particularly love the aesthetic of sugar and cinnamon", "I felt like it kind of fell into the muffin", "but it was delicious nonetheless", "I might do it a little bit differently next time", "but they were definitely all eaten up and a great pairing is this pumpkin espresso from brushed machine", "so I paired the two", "and I am not a huge coffee drinker", "but when I am pairing it with a muffin like this I do like it in the fall and winter months", "next I am gonna be making a veggie chili we love to make chili on Sunday nights for Saturday Night Football", "so I am starting with some veggie broth", "and then I have some black beans I am going to be adding some garlic some onion I have some jalapeno", "so it is nice and spicy a little black pepper and salt red pepper flakes and some diced tomatoes and some corn so that is why am adding that all into a slow cooker or a crock pot which you can get a slow cooker or a crock pot for about 25 bucks", "so worth it", "they are amazing", "I cook so many different things in my crock pot and you can start it and set it and forget it which I am all about when it comes to cooking so set it and forget it works for me so that is why am gonna", "add all these ingredients together", "and then I am gonna put the top on turn it on high and leave it on for about 4 to 5 hours", "you can also cook this on a pot if you want and wait till it is reduced and has kind of like a chilly texture or consistency", "and then you have some easy veggie chili", "so this can easily be a vegan chili if you prefer", "but you can also add cheese and that is totally optional and tortilla chips", "and then it is kind of like a taco chili which is actually really delicious", "and this is a total crowd pleaser you can also make it less spicy depending on who you are giving it to for my son", "I will make it a little bit less spicy but try out this recipe and let me know what you guys think next we have some pumpkin Alfredo which is different", "but I wanted to try this one out and see what I thought so I am starting by picking some fresh sage from the garden", "and I am gonna go ahead and fry up the sage in oil", "so that is why am literally gonna pour oil into a pan and fry", "the sage", "then you can put fresh sage on top of pasta but fried sage is kind of a thing I guess so", "that is why decided to try that in combination and it was a really good flavor combo with the pumpkin in a large pot to the side", "I am bringing some water to a boil and I went ahead and put some alfredo noodles in there they are cooking then in the infused oil the sage infused oil that is already in the saucepan I am adding some garlic and some pumpkin puree next if you want this to be a vegan pasta you can add coconut milk or you can add heavy cream now", "I know pumpkin and coconut may not sound good together", "but it was actually pretty darn delicious", "and this was definitely an experiment for me because I wanted to try something a little different and off the wall", "so I put the alfredo noodles into the sauce", "mixed it up", "so it is nice and hot", "and

powder", "I have paprika and a little bit of red pepper salt and pepper", "is good now", "if you have kids obviously my son does not like it too spicy", "so that is why do not add too much paprika",

it", "it is a hit", "everybody really likes it", "and it is super easy because it is throw and go", "you do not have to think about it", "and it tastes good", "so that is why am using the tofurkey

pan dinner when I was in college", "I used to take a weight training class and every day after my weight training class I would come home and make myself salmon brown rice and veggies", "so something I d like to do is another one pan recipe is in a pan", "I put some olive oil", "I am gonna put some asparagus", "but you could do broccoli if you wanted or another green of your choice", "but I like

why have basil I have sage", "and I have tons and tons of rosemary", "so I have my little buddy", "Ozzy here he is a rescue puppy", "we adopted a few weeks back and if you follow me on Instagram you will have seen some of my Instagram stories with him", "but I have not done an official introduction on youtube", "yet", "so he is hanging with me a lot these days", "and he will be in a lot more of my videos for the sake of this video", "I decided to share a few different herbal water choices that I like", "so we are actually going to be making four so on the left side of the screen top", "left we have orange and rosemary", "so it is going to be orange and rosemary infused water then on the top right", "we have peaches and sage that one was so good", "the bottom left we have strawberries and basil", "and then we have on the bottom right blueberries and rosemary", "and you can also add a little bit of lavender", "if you have it in there as well when you go to nice spas they often have herbal waters or infused water so by having this while you are having a bath or a shower it kind of gives it that spa feel even if you are not gonna do a spa day herbal waters are great for get togethers or", "bridal showers baby showers", "there is something that a lot of people enjoy", "so next we are making lavender and eucalyptus hot towels", "I would not normally make this many hot towels just for me", "but I wanted to show you for the sake of this video I am adding a cup and a half of water to the bottom of the slow cooker about five or six drops of eucalyptus and five or six drops of lavender essential oil", "then I have rolled up face towels", "but I am gonna put in there", "and I am gonna put another cup and a half of water over that so that is why are gonna put the top on the slow cooker turn it on to medium or high heat depending on how soon you want them", "and these are great for like a girls spa night in", "you have nice hot towels so next I am preparing the scrub and the masks that I am gonna be using for this treatment", "one scrub that I like is equal parts coffee coconut oil and granulated sugar", "this makes for a really great body scrub so that is why am prepping that I have this clay mask right now", "and I have been meaning to try it", "so that is why am actually just mixing it with some avocado oil equal parts clay mask and avocado oil for a little bit more of a hydrating mask", "so whenever I do a spa day I try to pick a mask that is appropriate for how my skin is feeling in the moment there were so many different masks out there to be honest", "I do not even have one favorite I go based on my skin", "is needs if I am noticing some hyperpigmentation I will go for a brightening mask if I am feeling dry I will go for a mask that is going to hydrate and nourish if I am feeling oily I will go for maybe a clay mask that does not have oil", "so try to choose a mask that is appropriate for your skin type so now that I have done all the prep work", "I am gonna start my treatment if you have a group doing facials you can bring out all the towels or you can have", "one hot towel for yourself run a hand towel under hot water and you want to air it out so that it is not too hot and once it feels like a good temperature to put on your skin", "you could put it on your skin and the steam will open up your pores", "it smells really nice and relaxing because it has the lavender and eucalyptus", "and then I am going to cleanse and exfoliate my skin with my Clarisonic brush next I am applying the mask after I have cleansed my skin", "and this is before I enter in the bath", "so that is why am gonna keep this on while I take a bath", "but you can also apply a mask if you have a shower", "and you do not have a bath", "put a mask on before you go in the shower", "bring your drink in the shower with you and just enjoy a nice warm shower", "and you can even spray some eucalyptus in your shower or some lavender", "I have a facial steamer machine that I bought a while back which I absolutely love", "but you can just take hot tea water and put it into a large bowl and have your face just above the bowl you can put herbs in there as well", "and that is a great way to open up your pores while you have the mask on", "so now I am gonna get in the back", "and I am gonna be using some Rose bubble bath a lot of the things you see here I have made on my channel if you want to find out how to make the bath tray in the candle I made those in my upcycle video and then", "I also made the bath salts in a previous video so that is why will link those so unfortunately this bath lasted about 18 minutes", "but I did get a nice good soak before I realized I was running out of time", "and I had to get out", "I made sure to take off the facemask and then", "I also jumped in the shower for just a few seconds on cold and used my scrubs so the caffeine kind of woke me up so if you are doing a daytime spa treatment you can do that", "if it is nighttime you might want to relax and chill and go to bed so that is why might want to skip the cold shower part but", "a cold shower can make your hair look shiny it can make your skin look really healthy", "and then when you are using that with the caffeine scrub it is a nice kind of wake up call for your skin", "and then I am going to put a little bit of moisturizer on the moisturizer that I like", "is the coconut moisturizer from the body shop", "so that is why am going to be using a little bit of that on my skin so it does not feel dry", "and that completes my spa day for today", "hopefully this gave you some ideas and you have a spa day for yourself", "and I will see you guys very soon in the next video", "bye you"], "ofKRbbKZw5c": ["hey guys welcome back to my channel today I am doing a nother DIY video for around the house", "this is another series that I plan to do on my channel everything from home decor DIY decorating gardening pretty much everything that I will be doing to kind of get this place in order today", "I am gonna be working with wood and making a few things for around the house I am upcycling a wood caddy I found on my property to make a succulents caddy making some shelving and also this", "really fabulous towel and blanket ladder", "so let is start with the succulents", "caddy", "so like I said I found this on my property it was left here by the previous owners", "so that is why decided to upcycle it and use it", "so basically I put these plastic containers inside", "I am putting some rocks on the very bottom for drainage then I am gonna add some potting soil", "and I am gonna just fill it with beautiful succulents which I usually find my succulents at Home Depot or you can find it at Trader Joe", "is this looks great outdoors which is where I am going to be putting it", "but you can also use it as a centerpiece for your table if you live in an apartment you can place it in areas like window seals at your apartment it can add life to any place that you live", "so succulents is a really great way and you do not have to water as much the key with succulents", "is to keep it in the shade and water it", "every few days it likes to be kept in the shade believe it or not so that is why am filling this to the brim so that it looks covered in succulents", "and then I will have a super easy up cycled wood caddy filled with succulents I have seen caddies like this at flea markets you can find them at garage sales you can also find them at places like home good", "sometimes Target has things like this", "but this is an idea super easy for decorating around the house next", "we are making some galvanized piping wood shelving i have seen a lot of this type of thing on etsy but also very expensive stores sell galvanized piping shelving", "and it can get pricey", "but you can also make it for a fraction of the cost by getting the items at Home Depot now what I am gonna do is I am taking these pieces of wood", "I got them cut at Home Depot", "so that is why can either get your wood cut at Home Depot or you can cut your wood at home", "and I will show you a little bit about that in a second", "but I got these I measured", "how long I wanted them", "so that is why can make them longer or shorter", "and then I am using the rest of my stain", "I used the first half of the stain on my upcycle video so if you go back and watch that video you can see me using the stain", "but I am gonna go ahead and finish this up by staining these pieces of wood so that is why I have several pieces of matching wood throughout the house you can mix and match wood", "but I decided to finish up the stain so that is why am gonna stay in front and back and all the sides and let that dry usually for about six hours so to build the piping you are gonna want galvanized caps", "these are about 2 250 apiece", "and I got 4 total", "I got four of the galvanized floor flanges", "and then I got some piping galvanized piping", "so basically I am going to screw the piping into the floor flange and then on the other side I am gonna screw on the cap", "and then you are going to have all four of these which you are then going to drill into the wall and that will hold the wood shelving now", "hanging picture frames and shelving is a whole nother video in and of itself", "so that is why am not gonna dive too much into detail on this", "but I did measure", "and I made sure to mark where I am going to want my shelving in this case I am putting one shelf on either side of this map that I have on my wall", "and then I am gonna", "take my power drill and drill holes into the wall since I was having trouble finding a stud I used anchors so basically anchors anchor into the wall when you ca not find a stud", "so if you ca not find a stud you want to use an anchor and that is gonna keep it nice and sturdy so that your shelving does not fall when you put items on top of it", "so I am gonna drill the screws into the anchor", "and then I am gonna go ahead", "and it is level", "and it is even", "and I am gonna do it on the other side as well", "so that is why marked it", "I am drilling the holes putting in the anchors and then drilling in the screws", "and then I can put my wood shelving on top so since I am hanging two shelves I did the right side", "and then I made sure to measure it appropriately so that it is completely even and level on the next side of the wall on the opposite side of the map so that is why measured that", "and then I am gonna put the wood on top of the piping", "and then you can put picture frames or whatever it is that you want to put on top of there", "and you have", "a do it yourself version of galvanized piping wood shelving this room is still a work in progress", "this is like one of the first things I have done in this room there is not much in here", "so that is why will do a full house tour once I am done decorating", "but I like this little touch in this room", "and there is a barn door entering this room which might be a playroom or a game room", "I am not sure", "so so far I have the map and the shelving", "and I think it looks good alright", "so next I am moving on to the DIY towel ladder it can also be used in the living room for a blanket", "I have three long pieces of wood", "now I chose this color", "it was already stained this color when I got it at Home Depot", "now the great thing about making one of these ladders yourself is that you can totally customize it size and width", "so you want to measure how tall and how wide you want your ladder depending on where you plan to put it", "I decided on the ladder that would be 60 inches tall and 21 inches wide so that is why am using a miter saw here to cut my pieces of wood accordingly", "and if you have never used one of these before it can be really intimidating but be sure to wear safety goggles and watch a tutorial on safety precautions before using I will be sure to link a good one below", "so please check that out before using a miter saw starting with the left side of the ladder I am going to drill some holes with a drill bit", "this drill bit is not long enough to make it through both pieces of wood", "but if it was I would not need to put an additional piece of wood underneath", "but it does not make it through to the other side", "so that is why do not have to worry about it in this case", "I am drilling holes", "and then I am gonna drill in screws on the left side", "then I am going to prop the ladder up and make sure it is level to screw in the right side of the screws", "so this is", "what I did to everything is level", "so I did that", "and then you have a great towel or blanket ladder that you can put in your bathroom", "you could put it in your living room and these can get pretty pricey so the materials for this we are about eighteen to twenty bucks", "so that completes this video", "I hope you enjoyed it", "I will try to put all the details of what I purchased at Home Depot in the description below so be sure to read that if you are interested thanks so much for watching", "and I will see you guys very soon in

and share with you guys a few lunchtime recipes that I like that you can make ahead of time or make right at lunch time keep your eye out for meal planning videos I will be doing breakfast lunch and dinner and then repeating that so that there are lots of recipes that I can share with you guys and you have lots of different options so starting with the first one I am making a quinoa Bowl", "so I am starting with some spinach", "I am just kind of chopping that up loosely very rough", "I chopped up some green onion and also some avocados", "and I am cutting some cherry tomatoes in half", "then I am cooking up some quinoa I like to prep quinoa ahead of time because I use it for a few different recipes so what I do is 1 cup of quinoa to 2 cups of water bring it to a boil reduce it to a simmer put a top on and let it kind of steam until it looks fluffy like this very similar to how you would cook rice so that is why am putting the quinoa down at the bottom", "and then I am going to add the spinach", "the tomatoes the avocado and the diced onion", "and I am going to add some balsamic vinegar a little bit of olive oil and some salt and pepper this by itself can definitely be filling", "but you can also use it as a side with some protein there is a lot of different options you can do with this particular salad or quinoa Bowl if you will", "so that is why like to make it ahead of time", "you can keep it in the refrigerator for a few days and you can reach for it at lunch time when you want to pair it with something else or eat it by itself", "the next recipe is another one you can make ahead of time", "it is easy", "I started with some brown rice pasta", "I just cooked that up there little spiral pastas like I did with the quinoa I am actually adding the spinach into the warm pasta that is been cooked and rinsed and this will kind of cause a little bit of cooking for the spinach so the spiritual wilt a little tiny bit", "I did the same thing with the last recipe with the quinoa", "I added the spinach into the warm quinoa so that is why had a chance to kind of cook", "a little bit I am dicing up some tomatoes", "I added some mozzarella mozzarella", "my pronunciation is probably wrong", "but anyway I am also gonna add some Italian dressing into this that I got at Trader Joe", "is shaking it up", "I am gonna pour a little bit in there", "you can put as little or as much as you want and then stick this in the refrigerator you want to cover it stick it in the refrigerator", "and you have", "a cold pasta salad now this is great by itself", "but it also works great as a side to a sandwich", "so if you want to make a sandwich and have this on the side if you want to have it by itself it is one of those things you can make ahead of time", "and you will find yourself reaching you", "can also pack it up and take it to work with you if that is easier so this is a nice lunch option and something that you can prep ahead of time and have in your refrigerator it lasts for a few days I d say", "about three or four days before you need to toss it", "so I am adding a little bit of salt and pepper", "and then that finishes up this really easy cold pasta salad", "this next bowl is yummy", "it is a Hawaiian tofu bowl", "this one is best eaten pretty much right away", "so it is not so much a prep you could prep it ahead of time and eat it", "but it is good", "just freshly made", "so that is why am starting by grilling up some pineapple slices so that is why am gonna grill those up in a pan", "I am gonna cook up some firm tofu which I get from Trader Joe", "is and I am gonna let that brown on both sides", "then I am gonna add the island", "so yaki marinade to the tofu", "and let that cook for about 2 minutes", "or so the tofu really takes on the flavor of the island so yaki marinade", "and I get that in the marinade section at Trader Joe", "is it is really delicious", "and so that is why am gonna let that cook you can make this with rice jasmine rice brown rice", "I am making it with quinoa", "you can choose however you want to do it", "I am taking the rest of the quinoa from the day before and", "I am gonna use this", "and then I am gonna put the tofu on top", "i steamed some veggies which are totally optional I have zucchini and some bell peppers that I am going to add", "and then the pineapple on top of that this is pretty quick and easy to make", "but it is SuperDuper yummy", "and it works for a lunch or a dinner", "so that is why would definitely try it out and definitely try out that marinade", "it is unreal", "so next I am making a hummus avocado sandwich very easy", "I use Ezekiel bread", "but you can use any type of bread you want Ezekiel bread once it gets toasted", "is a little bit of a drier bread I will say", "but I tend to stick with Ezekiel bread", "it is a sprouted grain bread I am spreading some hummus adding some avocado some tomato a little bit of salt and pepper you can add spinach if you want lettuce if you have it if you want to add Turkey or whatever you want to add to it", "I am keeping it simple like this", "and I will have a sandwich that I will prep I will put it in a ziplock bag and take it with me if I want to", "and you know you can also pack some of the cold pasta", "salad to go on the side or a little", "salad on the side", "some soup", "so this is something that you can pack ahead of time and take with you the next day super easy to throw together", "but I think the key is having a few options that you can pair", "so these are a few quick ideas for lunch I will be sharing

is why am applying that first and foremost the next product that I like that", "is also", "multi purpose is the Olay eyes eye cream", "it has a light tint", "so it doubles as a concealer and an eye cream which", "I like Lord knows I am not getting a lot of sleep these days", "and I have dark circles under my eyes and redness", "so this is nice and", "it cuts having to use concealer", "it is my favorite drugstore eye cream by far", "so I am using this one", "then I am going to be using the magic foundation by Charlotte Tilbury", "I have been going back and forth between using this and also the it cosmetics CC cream which I like the CC cream is a little thicker than this one", "so that is why like this formula because it is lightweight", "but it also provides really good coverage so that is for any uneven skin tone redness", "then I am using the Make Up For Ever Jessie J palette", "this is another one of those multi purpose products that makes my routine a little quicker and easier you can throw it in your handbag", "it has a bronzer a pretty highlighter and blush", "I apply bronzer on to my cheekbones or anywhere that the Sun hits I suck in my cheeks", "and then I usually blend it out with a Beauty Blender so that it is not harsh and then", "I also like to use the highlighter which is a really pretty like golden tone", "it is not so frosty looking", "but I think it gives a really nice highlight above the cheekbones and then", "I also apply the blush which is a pretty blush as well so that is why like this palette the Anastacio brow pencil is a ride or die makeup product I have been using for years", "I love it", "I constantly go back and get it", "and I use it to fill in any spaces and my brows and try to make them look as even as possible so after my brows I quickly move on to my mascara", "the L Oreal voluminous original in the color carbon black is", "my favorite drugstore mascara", "my next favorite would be the tarte mascara which i also use a lot have been using for years the tart is a little bit of a drier formula than this one so it does not end up under my eyes by the end of the day as much as this one would", "but I still do like this one because it does not clump", "and I do feel like it makes at least for me", "I feel like it makes my lashes look really nice", "I have tried so many different ones and this one seems to give them a really nice full look now I have been using the lip sense in sass easy someone actually sent this to me", "I like it because it is a long lasting lipstick so that is why can put it on you", "can kiss your kids it stays on your lips and does not move all day long", "but I will say I do not apply this the way that distributors recommend you apply it", "they like", "you to do one coat", "let it dry", "and then two additional coats", "so three coats total and let them dry in between", "I do one light coat", "and then I do kind of like a line", "so it looks like I am lining my lip", "I feel like three coats is too much in this color", "so this is what I do", "and then I use the gloss on top of it", "I do let it dry if you want to know exactly how to apply this product I would look up a distributor or someone who sells it", "and they can explain how to properly do it", "but this is how I do it", "and it works really well for me it does last all day long", "and I like the color because it just looks like how my lips look when they are a little chapped and you have that kind of like rosy lip or after you have been snowboarding or out in the cold for the day and your lips do not feel particularly good because they are chapped but they look nice and rosy I like a lip color that makes my lips look like that that might sound weird", "but anyway I am using The Naked palette the good old Naked palette in the color buck I am using a tiny bit on the corners of my eyes to complement the mascara so not going for a full eye shadow or anything like a little tiny bit", "and then I clean up the makeup", "so everything looks smooth", "and it is all blended in properly", "and then if I am looking a little shiny I will use some Ben Nye powder", "I think I said that right I am a little bit of the powder just underneath my eyes anywhere that looks a little shiny", "and then if I am doing a five minute makeup routine that means I do not have a lot of time", "so that is why do not have a lot of time to do my hair in that case", "I will let my hair dry naturally", "and so my hair is 50 percent dry it is been in the towel the whole time", "so that is why am just gonna brush it out", "I

more", "but there was a few things that i did register for that i did not have with oliver that i really like that i want to share and also some things that I have kind of been using again this time around that i think is worth investing in because you can use it you know throughout however many kids you decide to have", "so i wanted to share that with you guys and that is", "kind of what we are gonna do today", "so um so I had Isaiah on Thursday it will be eight weeks", "and I am feeling really good", "you know the first few weeks postpartum are difficult", "I am not gonna lie", "I think it is a combination of feelings you feel elated to have a new baby", "but there is a lot going on with your body", "and I kind of talked about this in other videos", "and I talked about it before when I was pregnant just saying that you know pregnancy is is difficult", "I get nauseous at the beginning and at the end I get it feels like I am running out of breath and", "a lot of like kind of different symptoms and things happen but I would say at the end of my pregnancies I do feel really motivated because nesting comes in even though I feel like I have to take rests often", "and I take naps throughout the day which is not normally what I do at the same time when I am up and about I have this like nesting thing so that is why am like go go go", "and I feel calm and excited", "and and then right after I have the baby I am just like overwhelmed with joy", "and you know those first few days where you are like first meeting your baby", "the first six weeks are kind of rough because like I said there is a lot going on with your body", "you know you are for me", "it is like I was bleeding for the first four weeks", "and I had other symptoms I had to go", "and I was having like a weird leg pain", "and they wanted to", "I was not having blood clots", "and then I started getting some weird hip pain", "so I would say the best way that I describe it is", "it is kind of like a little bit of a thunk you know that funk", "you get in right before you are getting ready to have your period for me", "I did not feel depressed it never really got to that level with either of my kids but some people described it as like baby blues there is like different levels of it", "some people get slightly anxious some people get a little bit more edgy or feel funky some people describe it on a different level as like kind of baby blues or the feeling of like wanting to weep out of nowhere", "and then it can turn into postpartum depression as well", "and it is extremely common actually", "and I feel like there should not be any shame around talking about it because there is something chemically going on inside of you", "right after you have a baby it is almost like everything kind of drops and your body is going back to normal and there is a lot happening", "as you know I hit that six weeks", "I definitely start to feel the that little cloud of like funkiness lifting", "and I get more into the groove this time around", "like I said I am more more comfortable with a newborn", "and he is so cute", "and I am having so much fun with him", "it is funny because Oliver is like so sweet with him and wants to be so involved he is so sweet and so excited to help that sometimes he is like overly like he will be like jumping on the bed when Isaiah is on the bed", "and like I have to you know instead of being like what are you doing your brothers on it you know", "which which sometimes is a mom", "you feel this like why are you doing you know and the other day too like", "I think I tweeted about it", "but he like he wants to like kiss Isaiah and for the first few weeks the doctors told us like to be a little careful with too many kisses on the face and things like that because babies can get sick easily and Oliver actually did gets he had a cold and Byron had a cold", "so that is why had to kind of be", "like no you ca not kiss your brother and", "that was hard trying to just like keep him isolated in his own room", "so", "but anyway the other day I tweeted about the fact that he was like he like was licking Isaiah", "I am like", "why are you licking like you can kiss him", "but like licking and that is a much", "okay they can better the licky", "so it is funny just like balancing that and figuring it out", "we are at that age with Oliver right now where you know we have to be strict like you need to listen to us", "and you need to go in timeout", "if you are not gonna behave", "and so that is like", "that is something worse", "and we have been implementing before Isaiah came into the picture and now it is like continuing to do that and continuing to be consistent and and that along with having a newborn there are moments where where you can feel overwhelmed", "and I have definitely had a few of those but", "overall after the six week period things start to really go a little bit more smooth", "I get into a schedule something that I am starting to understand too", "is that my husband and I are responsible for setting the tone for our home and our family and part of that is setting a routine and for me a schedule of some type not makes me feel more sane less anxious overall and actually more calm it is", "like you think a schedule is gonna make you feel like I gotta stick to the schedule", "but overall it makes me feel a lot more calm so implementing a schedule which I have been trying to do it shifts around a little bit because we go out", "and we do things", "and I ca not always stick to that schedule to a tee they both sleep at the same time right now in the day for a few hour naps so that is really nice because it gives me some time to get some things done to think and because sometimes it is hard to like think about things that you need to get done or you have a bunch of things you have to get done you do not know where to start you feel overwhelmed", "sometimes things like that happen", "but when I implement a schedule it does for our family help and it does set the tone for the whole family I feel like those days go way more smooth when when there is like some sort of plan you want to be flexible but have some sort of schedule where you have an idea of when things are gonna happen", "and so I feel like I can be more go with the flow when I have a schedule which might sound weird", "might sound like an oxymoron but", "the weird thing is is that for some reason for me that helps so that is why am still implementing that", "and once I kind of get that down I will do a video on what that looks like because we are still", "we are still kind of adjusting and everyday changes as your baby gets a little older and and all that", "so anyway that is kind of where we are at Isaiah is growing he is doing well", "I am still breastfeeding him breastfeeding is you know tricky I had the same issue last time where I had really good supply at first", "but as I lose weight naturally my supply goes down", "and so that is something that you know", "I battle against he is doing really good", "his hair is", "crazy people always ask me if I put gel", "and I do not put gel in his hair",

when we go into stores it feels like every grocery store is freezing", "so that is why always put one of these over him", "it is great for swaddling I love these swaddles and that what when you wash them they just get softer and softer so modern burlap I love supporting kind of like small companies like this because I know it is hard for those kind of companies to get off the ground", "and they do a good job they have cute and unique swaddle blankets", "so check them out also a good gift too if you are looking for a good gift to get for you know a new mom the next one that I want to show you guys is the snoozer which I had with Oliver", "and I think I mean some people say that this goes away with your second or third", "which is that waking up in the middle of the night and wondering are you still breathing and that did not go away with Isaiah", "I still feel that way this does bring a lot of peace to my mind", "so that is why turn it on you", "put it", "you put it on the top of their diaper", "it has like a little clip", "here you turn on like that and then with every breath when their tummy breathes it monitors it", "and it gives you a little green light to monitor their breath", "and if they ever stop breathing it will sound an alarm if it falls off it will sound an alarm", "so I do like this", "I do not even know if they still sell these anymore", "but I like this because it is easy it is portable", "you could take it anywhere with", "you throw it in your diaper bag and it works for me", "it just gives me", "it makes me sleep so much better", "I will say so that is why like this Isaiah still co sleeping he see and the arms reach co sleeper which is like a side sleeper so it is separate from the bed", "but it is right there", "and I did that with Oliver until I weaned him at four months", "and he was sleeping through the night", "once I weaned him he was getting a little bit more he was getting regular feedings", "and I knew exactly how much he was eating", "and I think he was more", "he felt full because towards the end my supply was really that is why I had to stop he was not getting enough", "so once he started once I weaned he slept through the night right away", "and that is when I put him in his crib so with Isaiah I am still breastfeeding once he is sleeping through the night he is going like three four four hour stretches sometimes", "it depends on the night so once he is sleeping through the night I will move him from the arm", "is reach to his own crib", "so", "but that is", "right now he is sleeping in the arms", "reach co sleeper", "and I really like that I like the momma rude", "I know mama use another hand me down I had with Oliver", "I used it again with Isaiah", "I really like it it is like a swing", "if you plan

do not need any of these things but in this day and age it is kind of nice", "there is a few you know things that make your life a little easier as a new mom", "but by no means do you have to have

to watch a game of football game and I am gonna bring it there", "and I put the play yard up when he is awake", "and then when he goes to sleep he sleeps in it when we are out and about", "or I will bring it around the house if I am doing something in the living room", "I will bring it in there so besides the mama Roo which I used a lot for Oliver", "I have actually used the docket at a time",

we plan to travel with our kids and it is one thing that I really feel like will be very helpful when we travel so for me", "I like it", "I have used it a lot more than I actually thought I would use it at first", "I was like", "okay", "this is kind of pricey", "I wonder if I am gonna use it and wonder what I am gonna think about it", "but I ended up reaching for it and using it all the time", "so that is the honest truth I feel like some people will feel like no I put my baby down on a blanket or but for me he loves it in there", "and I use it all the freaking time", "so that is why like it

am taking this up cycled whiskey bottle", "I mentioned this in my DIY upcycle video", "you can go check that out", "and I have this seventh generation", "it is actually a hand soap and a dish soap in

usually have that around as well", "so either the seventh generation or the Miss Myers is what I will use to clean the kitchen sink I use baking soda and dish soap", "so depending on which dish so if

to clarify even though I do clean the kitchen every day I do not clean the entire kitchen every single day I like to try to get to the stainless steel because it gets lots of smudges and handprints so that is why was in the market for a new stainless steel cleaner because I was not crazy about the one I was using before although I felt it worked great", "I like this method stainless steel cleaner", "I was turned on to this and now I love it", "I use it on my refrigerator and all my other stainless steel appliances with a microfiber cloth so if I can get the dishes put away the kitchen sink cleaned the counters cleaned and the stainless steel clean that makes a huge difference in how clean the kitchen looks", "and then I also like to try to spray and clean the surfaces of my bathrooms if I can do these things every single day it really does make my house look clean", "and then every three days I will go in and do some other tasks that I ca not do every single day some of the things I do every three days include vacuuming and sweeping the house obviously with hardwood floors", "you know", "I have these hardware they look like hardwood floors they are tile", "I use the Roomba which my mom actually got me as a housewarming gift", "the iRobot", "and I turn it on", "and it goes now", "I got to say it is not the most amazing vacuum you will ever get in your life", "but the great thing is you can turn it on and be doing other things and it does kind of sweep up some things that are on the floor it also really works great for the carpeted areas it does have downsides", "so I would not say that this is like the best thing that ever existed", "but I do like to turn it on because it kind it gets something done which is nice around the house so that I can do other things and not have to spend hours and hours vacuuming the laundry", "is another big one although I do not do it every single day I would say on average I do at least a load", "every three days sometimes I will do a few loads once a week", "it kind of just depends I have this laundry divider which I have talked about before on my channel and also on my Instagram story", "so I will divide the laundry I will go room to room to each of the hampers and divide the laundry", "do a few loads right now I am using the method concentrate and also the mrs meyer is fabric softener", "I like this laundry detergent concentrate because it is five pumps", "and then I will put fabric softener if I am cleaning towels I usually do not use it on clothes necessarily", "but I do use it for towels so they are nice and soft", "whatever the Roomba does not get I will sweep the floors there is nothing on the floors before I use the steam mop I am obsessed with my steam mop I have talked about it multiple times on my channel I try to steam the floors every three once a week depending on", "you know what is going on how they look", "I used to do it a lot more at the old place because we had a lighter color to tile and the areas that got heavy traffic looked really dirty and", "so using the Steam Mop everyday made a huge difference in how clean my house looked with this house", "I do not have to do it as often",

up and use the steam mop", "I also use the steam mop in my master bathroom and again if there is every three days once a week the next thing is what I do once a week now once a week I dust with a little duster in the bathroom I need to dust the blinds and", "I also have the same ones in my bedroom anywhere that gets dusty really easy", "I will try to dust once a week", "sometimes it is once every other week", "but you know if you can do it once a week you will keep the dust away which is nice so that is the goal is to try to dust once a week the other thing that needs to be done once a week is cleaning the mirrors usually in the bathroom and also the windows with a glass cleaner again", "sometimes it is once", "every other week I try to do it once a week if possible because they do get pretty dirty and once you clean those up", "it makes a difference also cleaning the toilets there is a method antibacterial spray which I like for you know cleaning the toilet and also the toilet bowl which does need to be cleaned once a week as well", "so toilets", "you know they get pretty dirty", "I have three different bathrooms", "so once a week they will stay pretty clean and I use the anti back tile it", "cleaner both from method", "I really like both of these products they work great and", "those are generally what I reach for when it comes time to cleaning the toilets once a week so super glamorous cleaning the toilets", "but we all have to do it for the most part also cleaning the shower and", "the tub I like this cream baking soda from mrs Myers", "you can use that with a scrubber to clean the bathtub and also the tile in your shower the glass doors and both the showers need to be cleaned once a week I use this method", "daily shower cleaner even though I do not use it every day I do use a squeegee every day", "or I try to make that a habit I try to make it happen a long time ago", "so that you do not have to clean the glass as often", "but I do use this once a week", "and I love the smell", "it is the best smell for a bathroom cleaner", "it makes it smell", "so good", "it actually makes it smell like a spa", "so I love that product for cleaning the shower doors now I do clean the kitchen stove usually once a week it is hard to do any more than that to be honest", "but it does get pretty dingy from all the cooking", "so I do like to that I clean this",

you need them most of these can work if you are heading out the door but a lot of them are great too for if you are home", "and you want something available first thing in the morning", "so without further ado I am going to jump into this video but keep an eye out for more meal planning ideas coming soon on my channel", "one thing I love in the morning is a smoothie or juice", "so planning ahead with a ready to go smoothie bag is a quick and easy way to do that all you need is a traditional ziplock bag or I have been starting to switch to reusable Ziploc bags", "which I really like", "and I am going to start by making a antioxidant rich ready to go smoothie bag", "and I am adding blueberries raspberries some chopped up strawberries and spinach the next on the ghost movie bag I am going to make", "is the sunrise movie", "this is basically one full orange you can use too if you want I am going to go ahead and peel and chop the orange and put that into the bag", "I have a whole banana

the bag so one bag last me two", "and you add any kind of milk I am adding coconut milk", "you could do almond milk regular milk", "you could also add green tea or orange juice coconut water", "there is a few different options I blend it up for a few seconds in my magic bullet", "and then I put it in a to go cup", "I get these to go cups at Target", "they are plastic and they also have plastic

going to make a variation of chia pudding today two different variations I am making some matcha Chia pudding", "right now matcha matcha", "okay", "so that is why am starting with coconut milk some matcha powder", "and then I am also adding some maple syrup to sweeten it up a little bit", "and then I am going to add a little bit of vanilla paste", "but that is totally optional depending on whether you have it", "and you want it", "and then I am going to blend that up and then add that to chia seeds", "and I am going to stir that", "and then you want to let this solidify the chia seeds kind of gelatinize and turn it into a pudding some people do not like chia pudding they do not like the texture", "but I love it", "and so that is why love a variation of chia pudding and I have made a variation on my channel so that is why am also going to make a chocolate chia pudding", "this is great for dessert too if you want it", "but you can also use it for the morning because it has a little bit of the cocoa powder but you can also add chocolate protein if you want instead", "and then I am adding the same maple syrup and a little bit of vanilla I am going to blend that up and then add that to some chia seeds and let that solidify and you can put these in mason jars put tops on let them solidify overnight", "and then you have a ready to go chia pudding in the morning if you want

go", "protein granola bars great for snacking on or a quick breakfast", "if you are running out of the house you can keep them in your diaper bag or your purse so starting with rolled oats I have a little bit of banana flour", "I have some peanut butter you can use almond butter if you want I am also going to add a little bit of cinnamon which adds a nice flavor I am going to add some sea salt

coconut milk and slowly continue to mix even more", "then I am going to take a baking sheet and some wax paper and flatten out the mixture on top of that and stick it in the refrigerator for three to four hours you can use a knife or a cookie cutter to cut these into a bar shape or a circle shape whatever you prefer", "and then I am going to wrap these up in some wax paper and put them in a

to get the Bistro boxes from Starbucks", "I get the protein box", "so something I like to do is I like to boil several eggs and keep them in the refrigerator they last for a few days", "so that is why will do four or five eggs and then keep those in the refrigerator", "but I am going to make kind of like a dupe or a copycat of the protein Bistro box that they sell at Starbucks and", "they are expensive so if you are on the go and you are hungry and you get one of these they can add up", "but we are going to make one quick and easy so that is why am taking one of the boiled eggs", "I am going to put that in its own container", "then I am also going to be taking some whole wheat bread putting that in another container", "I am going to put dry ingredients if you will in this container", "I am also going to put some almonds and two different kinds of cheese if you get the protein Bistro box at Starbucks they have two different types of cheese they have Brie", "and then they have a cheddar", "so that is why am doing baby bell", "and I am also doing a brie cheese", "then the Justin is peanut butter", "I am going to put that in there that is going to be for the apples I am going to put the apples in another little container", "and", "I also have some grapes", "now this has a little freezer pack I got this at", "I believe Vaughn is or Ralph is which is great because you can stack these on top of each other and they hold nice", "so this is a nice kind of lunch or snap to bring with you", "and it keeps it nice and cold for you", "and it is literally an exact dupe of that Starbucks bistro box", "so if you like that or if that is something that you have purchased before you can make them ahead of time and have them ready to go so hopefully", "this gave you a few

missing they end up in the laundry room on the floor or in the laundry basket", "and they can be there for weeks or months on end", "so that is why liked this idea because you can hang up a sock and

more rustic type DIYs and a lot of these", "are things that I saved different bottles jars vases little knobs like these ones you can find at Michael", "is for about three to five bucks each or you can find these at like flea markets", "second hand shops usually have them some wood pieces I found in the yard barn was chopping up wood for the fall and winter", "I am going to make some things with

you can paint onto glass jars bottles", "I am upcycling some old bottles vases and jars that I considered getting rid of in the move", "but I decided to keep so I can change them up", "and I love it

piece of wood the sliver of wood that he was actually going to throw away and when I looked at it", "I saw so much potential", "I imagined exactly what I ended up creating which was a really cool and different looking necklace holder", "but I knew I wanted it to be darker", "so that is why got the wood stain specifically for this", "and I am going ahead and painting the wood stain on there", "and then I am taking a cloth", "and I am dabbing it", "I am going to let that dry remove any like extra wood or maybe sand it down a little bit", "and then I am taking my drill I am going to drill a few holes equal distance apart", "and then I am going to take those cool knobs that I showed you earlier in the video I am going to screw those into the holes", "and then I ended up taking a dremel", "but you can use a hacksaw to you", "do not have any extra screw hanging out the back", "so that is why want to you can hang it clean against the wall", "and you do not have anything coming out the back of the wood I liked that each knob was totally different and unique because I was going for a very vintage rustic necklace holder now depending on the style of your home or your bedroom", "you could go for a cleaner piece of wood painted white gopher kind of a shabby chic feel instead of rustic", "but", "I also had to make sure I drilled a hook in the back because that is what I needed to actually hang it in my closet", "and I put it in an area of my closet that was empty", "I knew I wanted to put something there", "but I was not sure what it was", "and it went right above a great basket that I found and", "I am hanging various necklaces anklets different items that I want to either display or that I reach for on a daily basis and do not want to put in my jewelry box", "so that is why love how this turned out", "it was exactly how I imagined", "I wanted it to be for my closet", "and I feel like it makes it look like an old vintage shop", "and that is what upcycling is all about creating something unique with something you are going to throw away next", "I am making a DIY bath tray now unfortunately", "the bath tray that I had at the previous house did not fit on this bath tub because it is kind of wide", "so I made sure to measure it", "then I went to Home Depot and got a piece of wood", "the proper length luckily it was like six dollars for the large piece", "the smaller pieces are going to act as the feet if you will so that it does not shift around the bathtub so those pieces of wood need to be the same width as the larger piece of wood you want to", "it is going on the inside of the bathtub which I will show you in a second", "I did the measurements", "and then I took my drill", "and I drilled some screws to the feet go on the long piece of wood", "so I did that and then", "I also wanted to stain the wood itself you could keep the wood light if you want", "but I am going to stain it dark", "you can also paint it white again depending on your style and what you are going for", "I like", "this dark wood feel so that is why painted it and then", "I also took a cloth to wipe down any extra", "and then I just let it dry", "and then you have a really easy DIY bath tray now when I was referring to the smaller pieces of wood I measured this as well", "but you want to", "they fit on the inside of the bathtub", "as I put this down you can see it is going to allow it to not shift", "so that is why can just mark it with a pencil to you have the right placement", "and and I have that great jar that I painted the seafoam color I put some flowers in there",

is easy", "I also have the plant in the plant holder that is from Home Depot", "I had that in the last house as well", "and I move that to this place", "but I love how this looks", "and it was much less expensive than buying a bath tray online or in a store", "and it was pretty easy too next", "we are making an upcycled glass bottle with a Jack Daniels whiskey bottle which has a universal top that you can just basically take a old soap dispenser top and you can screw it on top", "so basically I took the Jack Daniels label off", "you can use a little bit of googan or bar keeper", "is friend will work really great for any leftover glue from the label and you screw the top on put your favorite soap", "it is either dish soap or hand soap", "I also use the other vase and put some flowers in there the seafoam vase and that makes a really great soap dispenser glass soap dispenser that was up cycled and really easy", "the next thing is an upcycled paint", "can now I used an old paint can",

updates", "and also I am going to show you my son Isaiah", "he is right here sleeping next to me", "so so this is my second baby", "so my second time around it was a little bit different", "there are some differences and there are some similarities so that is why had my son on July 6 2017", "Isaiah my first son Oliver was born January 3rd 2014", "so Oliver three half years old with Isaiah", "I started and I was similar with Oliver as well", "but I started having gets really uncomfortable towards the end", "so I was 39 weeks exactly when I had Isaiah with Oliver", "I had to be induced at 37 weeks", "I will link that video down below my water broke or I had a leak", "and so they had to induce me to prevent infection that was kind of a situation with that", "so that is why had him at 37 weeks", "Isaiah I had at 39 weeks", "but I started kind of having contractions and a lot of", "just it was", "it was basically full flavor", "and I went into the doctor you know probably 2 or 3 times thinking I was in labor because I was having regular contractions", "but then they would die down", "so that is why went in with contractions on let", "is see July 4th July 3rd", "so on the 2nd July 2nd I was having contractions", "but they were not progressing and", "they could not induce me because I was not 39 weeks yet and they have a policy about inducing before 39 weeks so they could not do that", "and I would not have met", "I wanted to progress naturally as possible so that was not my preference", "but I was having contractions I live 45 minutes away from the hospital so on July 4th",

bit more active in the sense that I was kind of like cleaning up around the house I would not like in bed", "so that is why go into my appointment that day he checks and", "I am dilated three centimeters and he said hey you know what you have been in several times you kind of have had contractions are not off and you are dilated three centimeters", "so that is why know if you do not progress before tomorrow you are 39 weeks tomorrow", "I can induce you if you would like", "and we kind of went over what that would entail", "and you know pitocin and all that stuff", "and I", "I said you know what I have been just having contractions a lot laboring", "I feel like all week", "and so if I do not progress before tomorrow", "then maybe we should do that", "so that is why went to go make my appointment for that", "and I was kind of hoping that something would happen that night because I I had a feeling I was in bed on July 4th", "just not feeling good at all and getting contractions but nothing consistent", "and it was kind of", "I was like", "oh I really hope tonight something happens", "so I am driving home for my appointment", "I am like I had been driving for maybe ten minutes", "and I am like I get a contraction", "and I am like", "okay", "and then I get another one so that is why actually I was driving for about five minutes and by the time I was 15 minutes from the hospital", "I got three contractions so that is why was getting one every five minutes", "and they were not like super painful at this point", "but I almost feel like I have to hold my breath or something", "I like kind of knocked the wind out of me", "and so that is why was getting these woggs driving", "so that is why pulled over", "and I called Byron Byron", "was like knee deep in a work project", "and I was like", "I think I am getting contractions he is like", "well what do you want to do", "and I was like", "well I might turn back around to be honest and go get some food and time the contractions and if they keep going then I am going to go back to the doctor", "and so that is why he is like", "okay", "I am working on this project", "but if something happens keep me posted so that is why turn back around", "and I go get some food", "and I start eating my food and timing them in there every six minutes", "but they are not progressing", "you are not getting particularly painful they are not", "you know they are doing the same thing they have been do which is that there every six minutes", "but I am like means they are going to go away", "it was a little concerned that I would drive 45 minutes home", "and then it was right around traffic time", "so that is why would get home", "and they would progress", "and then I could not I would be stuck in traffic that was like my fear", "I was gonna have a baby on the freeway", "so called my doctor let him know he is", "like you know what come on in", "and we will admit you", "and he is like if nothing progresses before you know it was up around five o clock at this time", "he said we will keep you until midnight", "and then we will induce you at midnight", "and I was like", "all right let go", "and they admit me", "and I get in the bed and the contractions start getting stronger and stronger around like seven or eight o clock", "they were like they were I mean with Oliver", "if you watch my labor and delivery story they offered me an epidural when they started me on pitocin", "and I took the epidural because I think the anesthesiologist was getting ready to go on lunch or something for two hours or something they were like he is going to be gone for two hours", "so if you want an epidural you might want to get it now", "so that is why got it before I really started feeling significant pain with this time", "the contractions were getting really strong", "I was in a lot of pain", "I was crying", "I was shaking", "I was like holding on the Byron for dear life there are some people who do not describe it as particularly painful and those people to me our freaking rock stars because it was painful", "you know", "and they would get it was like it is for me", "it was like wave", "so it would like start", "and I did not know how powerful they were going to be", "sometimes they were not", "as sometimes I could handle it", "sometimes they were so strong so long and so powerful at least about", "that I just I was like I ca not", "I", "I was like give me the juice", "so that is why told Barnes like you got to go out there", "and I was holding on to him like shaking and like tears rolling down my eyes", "I was trying hard to be strong", "but they hurt you know in my opinion they hurt", "so I told Byron to go and get the nurse", "and I said I would like an epidural they came in the epidural for me same with Oliver", "it is no more painful than when they the IV in you to be honest", "so the epidural is never an issue I think it nosh", "I got a little nauseous this time around but they did not end up giving me at energy medicine", "it is really quick", "and then you know you start to get warm in your legs and", "you start to obviously not feel your contractions", "anymore I still felt my contractions a tiny tiny bit in my chest like I said they would still kind of they were mild they were mild", "and then they started picking up right as soon as I got my epidural", "they picked up super hardcore because you could see on the screen", "and they were going faster and stronger and", "my labor was really progressing some people with epidurals it actually could slow down their labor", "but in my case it is like my body relaxed", "and it was like time ago", "full speed ahead", "so after I got my epidural things really picked up and were going really quick", "but it was mild for me", "so that is why was like I am going to take a nap before I have to start pushing and", "at that point I think I was dilated six or seven centimeters and I decided to take a nap", "and I took a nap barn", "turned on friends for me famous last time I took a nap and same as last time I woke up to them saying we are going to check you", "and then they checked me", "and they are", "like you are fully dilated it is time to start pushing so", "that is why got a good nap in right before I had to start pushing", "so things went a lot quicker this time with Oliver because Oliver I was pushing for a long time", "so I started pushing", "I did three push", "it was like Oh two three", "and they were like", "okay we are going to wait a second keep pushing give it a second", "and they like waited", "and then they are like", "okay", "so now we can start pushing again", "I pushed three more times three and then BOOM Isaiah was out", "and they put him on my chest with Oliver", "they took him away and bathed them and cleaned him up a little bit", "but they changed their policy they ca not do that for four hours", "so they put him right on me", "I started feeding him and that was that", "and so I mean looking back at it it went really smooth", "and it was", "I was happy that they did not have to do something they did not have to give me any citizen", "obviously I did get", "an epidural epidural went really smooth", "I have not had any problems with my epidural", "you know in my case", "Beryl helps I was able to take a nap", "I only had to push a total of six times", "my body was able to calm down and relax a little bit", "and then it sped up the process so for me it was a positive experience", "you know obviously everybody is situation", "is totally different and what everybody chooses to do is totally different", "so that was that the first few weeks postpartum are rough because you know I mean in some cases obviously you will hear cases where people are like it was great for me", "you know it was smooth sailin", "and then you will hear from other people like it was a disaster", "and like they never slept at all", "and so for me you know it is", "like I am you know up every two hours", "and I am bleeding from down there", "and I am also having like", "oh goodness", "I am also having like all these strange you know pains that are popping up and then breastfeeding is really painful", "and you have like sore nipples", "and so there is a lot you know the first and", "then after the first two weeks you start getting into the third week", "and then I started feeling a lot better the bleeding is subsiding", "a lot of my symptoms are going away your body is starting to go back to normal and", "breastfeeding is not hurting as much", "and then you start getting a little more energy", "so that is why do not want to do anything too crazy", "obviously you ca not even start", "well my doctor recommends not working out or anything until six weeks postpartum so that is why know", "I feel like last time too", "I", "I gained 30", "so that is why gained the same amount of weight last time as I did this time", "so that is why gained 35 pounds and that was what my doctor minimum said that I had to gain that was kind of naturally what I ended up gaining", "but online you know being online people were saying like", "wow he is gotten so fat", "and I have gotten a little bit of at this time but more so last time", "and I felt really stressed about that because I", "you know I felt like I wanted to that I was going to lose the baby weight", "and I felt pressured about that a little bit pressured is a better word not so much stress but pressure you know which can turn into stress", "and", "and I do", "not I think that was unnecessary ego that was completely unnecessary you ca not start exercising for six weeks postpartum anyway", "so that is why feel like you know eat healthy", "you feel like you are in a good state of mind that you are getting as much sleep as you possibly can and not feeling pressured not feeling those outside pressures I slept again", "and I was sitting back into my clothes eventually", "and like all that fell into place", "but I think I did not need to stress about it you know", "and I did a little bit", "and I kind of I look back in", "I do not regret so much", "you know", "but I I did not want to do that this time", "so", "so anyway I am going to introduce you", "hi pumpkin", "this is Isaiah ray Talbot", "I said what that was it was between Oliver and Isaiah for

names and then Ray is after Byron is dad", "Oliver Lee Talbot Lee is after my dad is middle name and raised after Byron is", "dad is middle name", "so so that is where we came up with the names and he

sweet", "so anyway he is sleeping", "so that is why will definitely do", "more like baby updates baby favorites some of my routine", "and you know organizing the new house and getting that all in

stone and you can pack fragile items with that the Dollar Tree also has cotton rounds and cotton balls those are helpful for packing cosmetics because sometimes cosmetics can break and a move so that

gloves tarp you can find labels all sorts of different types of tape", "face masks rope", "there is so many different things you can find there that if you buy it at another store it will add up to a lot more than what you pay when you go to the Dollar Tree another item that people pay for when they are moving that they do not need to is boxes often people want to get rid of boxes after they have moved and they will give them to you for free", "you can find them on Craigslist or Facebook groups or their friends of friends and we actually found so many boxes from a Facebook group and we were able to spend very little on additional boxes after we were done moving we wanted to get rid of them too", "so that is why ended up in someone else", "is hands so that is why get recycled now", "I knew we were going to be moving we were in escrow for several weeks", "so that is why wanted to", "I planned ahead", "I have these printouts that I actually have available on my blog so if you want to

got all the boxes ready to go", "we had family and friends come and help us pack", "I think they felt bad for me because I was so pregnant", "so everybody was helpful we also rented a u haul ahead of time", "so we knew what time to go pick it up what time to drop it off", "I think planning ahead whether you have movers or family and friends or", "you need to get a u haul", "I think planning ahead having a checklist is important when you are moving", "so that is why can print out that checklist that I made for free", "it is on my blog and use it to your benefit next time you move in addition to a checklist I also recommend getting colored dots which I found these at the dollar store and with the moving guy that you can also print out", "this is a little list of where all the boxes are going to end up so if you do have movers or friends and family helping put boxes in certain rooms they know which boxes go where most people write with a sharpie you know which items go in different rooms",

dot to represent hey if you see", "a pink dot take it to the closet and if anybody needed to reference it they could look on the little reference guide", "so again you can also print that out for free on my blog", "but I wanted to show you you can either use the labels which I think is great because then if you do recycle the boxes people can remove them but often it is easier to write with a sharpie and we ended up kind of doing that for the most part", "so you can see Rachel is", "closet items had a pink dot oliver is", "items had a blue dot and when you run out of colors you can use two different colors to represent another room so yellow and pink represented the master bathroom and moving", "is totally different for every single person so this might not work for you", "but this is helpful you know if people are trying to find which rooms are which and which", "things go it can be a little helpful especially when it comes to unpacking so if you think this will help you out be sure to print that out for free on my blog", "okay", "so next is to pack smart and here is a few packing hacks one thing for packing clothes especially in your closet is taking a bunch of clothes and using a garbage bag", "now I have seen this half done before but they did not try to recycle the trash bags", "and I think the really great thing about this hack is that you can recycle the trash bags and use them once you finish moving to throw items away they wo not be in perfect condition", "but you can still use them", "so you want to take a bulk of clothes", "keep them on the hanger and you are going to pull the garbage bag up and then usually the area that you will tie the garbage bag when you are finished using it that is going to go around the top of the hangers so it will keep everything intact", "and then it will be a matter of taking a few different trash bags full of clothes from one closet to another", "makes it so that your clothes do not get ruined", "they do not get dusty", "they do not get dirty and it makes for a really easy transition", "and you also do not have to use a box to pack up your clothes like I mentioned before it is really nice not with fancy

the padded envelopes to store my jewelry", "I am going to pack my everyday jewelry", "and I am going to put that in my overnight bag which I will talk about in a little bit", "so this is jewelry that

not necessarily need to box it", "you want to you", "do protect it", "and I am also going to take this makeup case", "and I am going to that", "I tape it up and", "I am going to take that in a car right over so instead of putting it in the truck I am going to put it in the car and consider it kind of a fragile", "this is one tip", "I really recommend which is putting saran wrap in between the top and bottom of a bottle", "we had a few explosions when I did not get a chance to do this so that is", "why highly recommend doing it to as much as you possibly can because it will prevent explosions and again to reiterate what I mentioned before using sweaters and t shirts is a great way to pack up the kitchen and fragile without having to waste packing paper or additional bubble wrap now we tried to start unpacking", "right away we were kind of in a rush to get everything going but for the first few days you want to pack a large plastic bin and also a packing bag now in the bin",

sponges some garbage bags Chargers toilet paper paper towels batteries Lysol anything you think you might want to access coffee with in the first few days that you might not be able to find from packing you want to", "you put that in a bin that you have right there ready to go also an overnight bag with", "you know your kind of essentials your toiletries pajamas a few", "you know items that you want to wear over the next few days", "so that is why in case you ca not get to clothing items or various items", "you ca not find them in boxes", "you have it right there ready to go so an overnight bag and", "also an overnight bin is helpful when you are moving this great little range that goes over two dishes we have some leftover wood somewhere the trees when Byron cut all the wood",

please", "so coming in from the garage we have a laundry room to my left which I", "you do not like reorganize", "and then we have our first guest bathroom by the kitchen", "then we have the kitchen

room here which we have not decorated at all a smaller capsule probably go in here", "all right this is the guest bedroom which Oliver sleeping in right now", "and then this is all her room we still have to get a little mattress and finish unpacking I am of the store going into the master and then right here this is the master closet", "so we have been here for a little bit everything is kind of

using a little bit of apple cider vinegar on a sunburn and that should relieve any type of stinging or burning and then to hydrate the skin use coconut oil that will prevent from peeling or obviously really dry skin after a sunburn now chlorine can be hard on your hair and after hours and hours in the pool in the summer you might notice your hair feels a little brittle and unhealthy", "so try rinsing it with a apple cider vinegar rinse", "now we are actually making a green tea apple cider vinegar rinse which is a little less intense than just apple cider vinegar by itself which can make your hair smell like apple cider vinegar so that is why am starting by seeping two bags of green tea like with the black tea you want to", "you get a nice deep tea", "and then you want to let that cool down", "I am going to do equal parts of the cold green tea and then the apple cider vinegar into a container like this that has a top", "so it is easy to dispense from your scalp down to your ends and what we are going to do here is you can stick this in the refrigerator or even the freezer for about 30 minutes to get it nice and cold that is going to help seal the cuticle I am going to apply this on my hair while I am in the shower", "and I am going to rinse my hair and then go on as normal with my shampoo the conditioner in the summer", "you can also get bug bites so that is why are making a homemade bug bite balm", "now many of the homemade bulbs that I make on my channel have a very similar base to start with over a double boiler I usually melt beeswax shea butter and some type of oil in this case", "I have avocado oil now", "what will change is the essential oils that we choose to use based on what the skin care needs are so in this case I am using calendula which fights inflammation I have some lavender and tea tree oil which are antiseptic so great for when you have had a bug bite I do add the essential oils after the melted oil has had a chance to cool down a bit", "and then I am going to pour that into a container and let that harden", "and then you have a homemade bug bite balm feel free to apply as needed on a bug bite for as often as you feel", "it is necessary", "so those are a few homemade remedies for some issues you may come into trouble with in the summer month", "hopefully this video helped you out and gave you some good tips if you like

back to my channel today", "I wanted to share with you guys a few little hacks and DIYs for preparing for a postpartum for breastfeeding and I am going to have a few more tips in the description below like some supplements that I recommend and different tips and tricks", "but obviously this is from one mom to another", "I am not a professional", "but my first tip is to get a free breast pump breast pumps are expensive and a lot of times insurance covers it", "so if you go on to this website called edge Park which I am not sponsored by this company actually heard about it from a friend", "and they recommended that I go on you", "can put in your insurance and your doctor and they will go ahead and contact your doctor and get a prescription for a breast pump you can choose from a variety of different breast pumps I got the medulla medulla I am not exactly sure how you pronounce it sorry medulla breast pump which those are really pricey", "and then they went ahead and shipped it right to my door", "and I got it", "I did not have to pay anything for it copay or anything", "and so that is a great resource", "if you want a breast pump you do not have to put it on your registry or buy it your insurance often will supply it so look into that website and", "then when you get it that you take all of the parts out and familiarize yourself with your breast pump before it is time to use it", "I personally found my breast pump to be invaluable with my first child", "and I wanted to try a different one for this baby and since it had been three years since I had had a baby", "my insurance provided another one for me to try", "so I wanted to try this particular one which I had used in the hospital when my son had jaundice", "they provided this for me to pump milk", "I was not able to hold him and my milk supply was not coming in because I was not able to breastfeed", "so it was important to get that start with a breast pump", "so I am Rifa Miller izing myself with this particular one it comes with nurse pads and pretty much everything else you will need it comes with two breast shields which this is what goes around the nipple", "and then it comes with connectors which these connectors are going to obviously help connect it to the device itself", "and then it comes with two valves and two membranes", "now it also comes with an additional two membranes in case one of them becomes ripped or torn and those go on to the valves as you can see here I am going ahead and putting them on to the valve and the valve is then put on to the connector like", "so", "and then I am going to show here again that I am putting the membrane on the valve itself", "and then the connector is connected to the breast shield now before I do any of this", "you want to make sure that you boil all pieces that will come in contact with milk", "the manual will instruct you to do this so that is why highly recommend reading it and familiarizing yourself of everything and also how to set it up that will explain it even better than I could in this video each breast pump is a little bit different in the parts that you need to sterilize but pretty much across the board it does recommend that you boil the parts before and then from then on you want to make sure you have a bottle cleaner", "I like this one by dapple", "my friend actually gave it to me and you can use that to clean all the parts that come in contact with milk from that moment on after you have started using it for this breast pump I have a face plate which is what this is called", "and you have tubing ports a port plug and then tubing so that is why am just putting the tubing into the tubing port", "and then you have the power adapter", "so you are going to have to plug it in you", "have an on and off button and an increase in reduced vacuum", "so that is why can basically increase the section and then a letdown button all of this will be in the manual but hopefully this can serve as an additional visual next", "I am going to share with you some tips for storing milk obviously", "I highly recommend getting milk storage bags you can find these at Target", "they are a few bucks and basically this is a place where you can pump directly into the bag", "and you are going to write the date that you pumped your milk into the bag", "and you can store it by freezing it now", "you want to lay them flat in the freezer to freeze", "but then once they have had a chance to freeze you can store them in an old soda container or in this case I have a sparkling water container", "and you can put them in order of dates so that you can access them easily", "so next we are going to be making a DIY booby butter", "you can find these all over the place", "but they are actually easy to make", "and I have made DIY body butters and things on my channel before this is really easy", "so for this all you need is three simple ingredients melted together over a double boiler", "I have some beeswax shea butter and coconut oil", "so the beeswax is going to help lock in the moisture into your skin look for a really clean shea butter", "you want pure shea butter which moisturizes and protects the skin and then coconut oil which is going to help regenerate the skin once those three ingredients have had a chance to completely melt I am going to pull that off the double boiler I am going to let it cool down for a minute or two", "and then I am going to pour that into a heat safe container and let it completely solidify", "and I am going to put that in my post partum basket", "I discussed two things in my opinion that I feel like I need after I have a baby in my hospital bag video", "and I made a post partum basket so if you want to know some of the other things that I recommend you can check that video out but something like this is really important if you plan to breastfeed because dry cracked nipples are a real thing and it can hurt and be painful and", "so something like this can be really helpful and moisturizing and making it feel better", "and you know which ingredients are in what you are putting on your skin next", "we are making a DIY lactation support cooking mix which you want to", "you have your calories up", "and you are eating a good amount when you are breastfeeding and", "these mixes are all over Pinterest I have used these before so you can also put this in the postpartum bag or basket so in a small bowl I am combining flour sea salt baking soda and baking powder and then in a separate small bowl I am going to combine the rolled oats flax seed meal and the brewers yeast brewers yeast is supposed to help increase your milk supply now nutritious foods are one component to help increase a healthy milk supply pumping drinking lots of water and trying to get as much sleep as possible", "you know there is a lot of other things you can do", "and I will put some more of my tips in the below but this is great to make for yourself as a special treat to help increase your milk supply", "but you can also make it for someone else", "and and it is a great kind of gift for a mom who is looking to do that so if you are a friend or family member and you want to make these cookies in a jar", "and then I am going to start layering in the jar so that is why have some brown sugar I am going to put some of the flour mixture in for the second layer I am going to put some chocolate chips I have some vegan chocolate chips that I am going to put", "and then I will put the instructions on how to actually bake these so once you give these as a gift or once you have these finished you can bake these", "and you can have these lactation cookies", "finally we are going to make a lactation support smoothie which is kind of similar to the cookies in the sense that it is supposed to help increase your milk supply so that is why have one cup of milk in this case", "I have some coconut milk", "I have some oats", "and then I have some ground flaxseed I am going to add some peanut butter and some frozen banana and", "then a little bit of chocolate mix add a little bit of brewers yeast again because that is supposed to help your milk supply and increase your milk supply I am going to add some ice", "and I am going to blend this up", "and this is a great quick way to increase your calorie intake and try to boost your milk supply plus", "it tastes good so that is why will put this in the description below try these out hopefully they can help you increase your milk supply and also check out the other recommendations

channel today we are making some crafts for kids these ones are a little bit more summer themed", "but these are fun to do", "hopefully you will try these out with the kids in your life and I am going to jump right in", "so I am starting with paper plate jellyfish and depending on the age of who is doing this crafts you can either get it started for them", "or you can let them do more of the work so that is why am basically cutting the paper plate into kind of like a Halfmoon shape", "and then I am putting out the non toxic paint colors and in this case I am going to let my son he is three and a half", "I am going to just let him go at it and paint", "I put something down", "he is pretty good about not getting everywhere with paint", "but we have had a few accidents in the past", "so that is why am just putting some paper down there", "and I am just going to let his creativity flow we decided to go for a Bluegreen jellyfish", "next we took some googly eyes and we glued them down with some Elmer", "is glue and", "then at this point it is kind of about decorating your jellyfish", "this is a easy project", "so a fun one to do with a class or if you are babysitting or with your kids you can make a few different colors that I could keep them busy for a while which is nice so that is why am just putting on these pom poms I am gluing them on", "and then I am going to use some ribbon for the little tentacles", "and I let Oliver choose all the different colors that he wanted", "so that is why are cutting out some light blue turquoise ribbon", "and I am going to go ahead and glue that to the back of the paper plate", "and then that will be the tentacles for the jellyfish next I am going to show you how to make some easy rainbow blowers again depending on the age of the child who you are doing this craft with you can either do it and make it for them to play with or you can do it with them or let them do it by themselves and basically taking some tissue paper colored tissue paper and some scissors I am cutting it into strips", "and then I actually have these toilet paper rolls these colored toilet paper rolls leftover from a project I did a while", "back one of my previous kids crafts videos where I made a car garage for my son", "so for this one I am cutting up these little strips and", "I am going to go ahead and glue them on the inside of the paper towel", "rolls so that they are coming out the end", "so that is why when you blow on the opposite side after they have had a chance to dry all the little colored tissue paper strips will blow into the wind Oliver is actually sitting there watching me he was very patiently waiting for me to finish these up he wanted to have me do it", "so that is why finished these up for him", "and then these are fun they can participate and play with these", "you know they do not last as long as other toys", "but it is fun because they are a part of it", "you know kids have these great imaginations", "so Oliver was pretending these were rocket ships and he was blowing into them", "and he was doing all sorts of fun things with them", "and they lasted for about a week", "I would say", "and then you know we tossed him", "but we had these little leftover toilet paper rolls", "anyway", "so it was fun to make it and have him be involved", "and it is a great way to kind of spend time with your kids and show them fun crafty things", "and then they also can play with it and use their imagination", "oh uh hey guys", "okay", "you wanna search for the diaphragm mass next was Oliver is personal favorite and this was the DIY dinosaur excavation starting with a plastic shoebox and some sand", "I have some sand some Michaels but you can pick up fans well outside if you have it", "and then I have some flour and salt and some water", "I have also seen people add non toxic plaster of Paris which makes the sand a little hard and you can do that", "but you can also do flour and water as well", "so that is why have these little dinosaur mini plastic toys you can find them at Target for like 5 bucks", "maybe 4 or 5 6 bucks", "and I am putting that inside the sand", "and then I am going to cover them", "and you are going to let that dry or hardened", "overnight then I am going to offer some paint brushes and a little spoon as a little digger so that is why can dig up the dinosaur he was stoked about this one", "and it was fun as his mom to watch him", "it definitely took him some time to do it to dig up all the dinosaurs", "and then when he was done he had dinosaurs to play with for a while", "so it kept him busy for several hours and if you have if the kid in your life does not really like dinosaurs", "but they prefer something else you can always do this with like plastic bugs or", "you could do it with really any toy", "and it keeps them busy", "it is fun", "and it is adorable to watch them get all interested", "so next we are making DIY bowling pins so once again", "I am using up the toilet paper rolls that I had in the craft closet I wanted to try to kind of get rid of them", "so I actually painted them white with non toxic paint for kids", "I have some red ribbon and I am wrapping to red ribbon across the top", "so it looks like bowling pins and", "I am going to go ahead and do this with all of them again depending on the age", "you can totally make this with them or make it for them to play with", "and so that is why just glued the ribbon on top of all of them", "and then you can grab a bouncy ball or whatever type of ball you have around the house", "and you can start showing them how to play bowling and trying to knock over all the pins", "so this one was another fun one oliver had a good time", "so you just wait for everything to dry", "and then they are ready to go", "then you need better knees down underneath", "em they look like how daddy is doing it", "swing it back", "Oh last but certainly not least", "we are making a DIY ring toss this one is really easy to make so that is why am taking some paper plates I am taking about three", "and then I am cutting out the center of them", "and then you can open them up and", "you will see they will have a great big hole in the middle and that is exactly what we are looking for", "so that is why am doing that with several", "then you can paint them with non toxic paint for kids", "I painted these real quick", "but obviously you can take the time to have the kids paint these and also set something down", "so that is why are a little bit easier to make messy because their rings", "but I did three different colors and then", "I also painted the bottom of a solid plate and that is going to be the where you toss the rings on to and for that one I took a paper towel roll and glued it on the solid plate", "and then you could decorate it with pom poms or different things that you have so", "that is why let all that dry", "and then it is time to play ring toss so that completes this

few easy recipes that are all plant based so perfect for meatless Mondays or if you are trying to go meatless a few days a week which is kind of what we have been trying to do I wanted to give you guys a few recipes that I think are really delicious so that is why am going to jump right in and hope you enjoy it", "the first recipe is super easy super delicious and kind of like a play on avocado toast", "it is an avocado quesadilla so that is why am starting with a tortilla I am heating that up", "and then I am going to smash an avocado on top of it now", "it is time to add some toppings a little salt and pepper", "you can add some cilantro green onion some diced tomato", "and then I am going to fold that over and put it right back on the stove and let it get nice and crisp", "and then I am going to serve it with some salsa", "so this is a really great option if you want to do dairy free", "but you can also dip it in sour cream if you want or you can put a little cheese on there", "but the point is to kind of have it be an avocado quesadilla", "and I got to say it is pretty good", "our next recipe is basil spinach pesto pasta I am going to start by cooking up some pasta shells I am going to let those soften in boiling water so that will take some time I am going to take the spinach I have about six loose cups of spinach", "and then I have a half of a cup of raw cashews one bunch of basil 1 4 cup of plain and sweetened non dairy milk", "and then I have a half of lemon juice and some salt and pepper to taste I am going to put this in my blender", "and I am going to blend that up till it is super smooth once the pastas done cooking I am going to strain that", "and then I am going to save a tiny bit of the pasta water", "and I am going to add that in later you will see", "but I am going to strain whatever portion of pasta I want to use", "and then I am going to save the rest for later", "so this pasta tastes good hot or cold", "so that is why can serve it either way", "but I am going to save a little bit of pasta and put it in the refrigerator for later in a pan I am going to heat up some extra virgin olive oil a little bit of garlic I am going to let that Brown", "and then I am going to add the pasta and also a little bit of the pasta water and just mix that up", "and then I am going to slowly add the pesto mix that until it is completely covering the pasta shells", "and then I am going to plate it and serve it", "like I said you can totally serve this cold or hot", "I like it both ways and", "if you want to top it with some Parmesan cheese you certainly can but if you are trying to go dairy free then you can omit Parmesan cheese and eat it by itself and it is super super yummy if you love something with a little kick and some spice you are going to love these cauliflower buffalo wings they are super easy and so good", "okay", "so all you need for this is one head of cauliflower I have 3 4 cups of water 3 4 cups of oat flour 1 2 teaspoon garlic powder 1 2 teaspoon salt a little bit of pepper", "and I am going to mix this with a fork really nice", "so it does not have any lumps in it", "and then I am going to actually dip cauliflower in this mixture and bake it", "and this is going to give it a nice crispy texture", "so that is why pulled the cauliflower apart and dipped it into this mixture making sure to cover it completely", "i preheated the oven to 450 degrees", "I lined a baking sheet and", "I am going to put that covered cauliflower that is been covered in that batter on the baking sheet", "and I am going to cook it for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown now", "if you want you can add a little bit of honey to the buffalo sauce to make it a little less spicy", "but I did not add honey", "I put the buffalo sauce directly on top and made sure to cover it", "this was some spicy buffalo sauce", "I thought it was going to make me go into labor", "but it was pretty good", "and if you like spicy you like buffalo wings", "these are a good kind of substitute for traditional buffalo wings and they serve these at a lot of mainstream restaurants now cauliflower buffalo wings", "and they are super good", "and they are not that hard to make so hopefully you try them", "and you enjoy them to last but certainly not least", "we are making jackfruit sliders which are a play on pulled pork sliders I have some onion here", "I am going to put that into a pan", "so that is why have about half of an onion sliced and diced here I am going to let that Brown", "and then I have jackfruit jackfruit is actually not that hard to find it is a lot easier to find it packaged", "but you can also find jax ur itself and use that it smells like tea when you are cooking it", "it is very floral", "but it absorbs whatever flavor you are using", "and so it is a really nice substitute for tacos basically like", "a meat substitutes are great if you want to do meatless pulled pork or tacos", "it is a little intimidating", "I will admit and like you are not sure how it is going to taste it is going to taste floral or whatever", "but it does not at all", "it takes on the flavor of whatever you are cooking it with", "so it is a great meat substitute", "I am adding some vegetable broth on top I am going to let that reduce I am going to add some salt and pepper as well I am going to continue to let that cook while I make a really quick coleslaw very easy to just have some chopped up cabbage", "and then I am going to add a little bit of vegan", "ease some vinegar and some salt and pepper mix", "that together I am going to top that on the jackfruit", "so I warmed up some ciabatta bread in the oven", "got it nice and crisp", "and then I added the jackfruit and the coleslaw", "and I served one to my husband and one to Shane who helps me", "fill my videos Shane", "is vegan", "my husband is not and they both liked it", "so it was a total win", "I hope you guys try it out and you like it too", "or you try one

halfway", "and then the rest I am going to fill up with sparkling water", "so that is why want to the lemonade", "is a little bit stronger than normal because it is going to be half sparkling water and half lemonade so if you want it to be sweet you need to make sure the lemonade is sweet or you can reduce the amount of sparkling water you use and put more lemonade in there instead", "but this

to my channel today we are doing some DIY beauty treatments specifically for the summertime", "so that is why am going to jump right in", "and hopefully you guys enjoy this video we are going to start by making a Beauty boosting virgin daiquiri drink to keep you cool and also to keep you looking great during the summer", "so that is why can make this before you do a beauty treatment or", "whenever you want it is basically just strawberries lime and a little bit of cinnamon you can omit the cinnamon if you prefer but it is ice strawberries and lime and if you want you can add a little bit of honey or agave I have it by itself", "but it is definitely refreshing and the strawberries are great for your skin", "it has a lot of vitamin C", "and it is also nice and cooling in the summer", "once it is finished blending up you can take it in pour it into a glass and top it with a little bit of lime or garnished it with a little bit of lime of course you can make an adult version of this if you want but", "alcohol is very dehydrating so it is not as much of a beauty boosting smoothie in that case", "but this is refreshing and a great addition to a summer pampering routine", "okay", "so next we are making DIY cooling sheet masks", "these are paper sheet masks with nothing on them", "they are basically you can customize your own sheet masks they come in bulk on Amazon for pretty cheap", "and then I am brewing some green tea waiting for that to cool down", "and then I am going to put the masks and this cucumber mix which I will show you in a second because I am going to be making some eye masks with the cucumber mix and then also I am going to make one with the green tea", "as well there are a variety of different mixes you can make to soak the sheet masks in and if you want to see more I can do a video on this you can do one for hydrating the skin hyperpigmentation anti aging", "but I am just doing a simple green tea and also a cooling cucumber I am going to stick these in the refrigerator", "and they are really great for the summertime for just cooling also", "if you are feeling puffy I get puffy in my pregnancies as I have mentioned before in my videos", "so these are great for that and just leave it on for 10 to 15 minutes", "these are the cooling cucumber iPads and basically I am going to start with cucumbers and some water", "and I am just going to mix those together in the Magic Bullet", "so this is the mixture that I used to soak the sheet masks in as well", "and these are focused primarily on cooling treatments and deep puffing and things like that which are great for the summertime when it is nice and hot outside", "so that is why am going to make that mixture once it is done completely blending", "then I am going to soak some flat cotton pads in the mixture", "and then I am going to put them in a ziploc bag", "and I am going to freeze them and", "these are going to be eye pads that you can put around your eyes if you are noticing puffy eyes cucumbers are often used around the eyes for cooling and deep puffing and that is something you may have seen before in magazines or when they are kind of depicting a spa and a movie", "this is kind of a play on that", "but you are going to freeze these", "and they are nice and cooling in the summer months and again great for deep puffing so try these out and see if they work for you next we are making a very easy cooling after Sun spray so that is why are starting with some aloe vera", "we are going to do a few drops of lavender and a few drops of peppermint oil mixed together I have shown before like in the last video", "I made the aloe vera ice cubes which are really great for an after Sun treatment I am putting two drops of peppermint essential oil to help with cooling and then two drops of lavender to help with healing it is a few drops", "too much peppermint oil is too much", "but you want to mix that together and stick that in the refrigerator of course if you are pregnant or breastfeeding be sure to run any essential oils by your doctor and make sure whichever ones you are using are okay with them", "and then if you have a sunburn you use a little bit on the sunburn for a cooling and healing effect next we are making a cooling face and body mist", "we are going to start with some distilled water and we are also going to be using some aloe vera and witch hazel so to start I am using about 1 2 of a cup of distilled water and 1 tablespoon of melted coconut oil", "then I am going to add some witch hazel I am adding a few squirts of witch hazel nothing specific exactly", "and then the same with some aloe vera", "and then I am going to add a drop or two of tea tree oil tea tree oil", "is extremely strong so that is why want to add a drop or two of tea tree oil to this", "and I am also adding a drop or two of either lavender or frankincense frankincense", "is a little harder to come by but it is extremely healing to the skin lavender", "is also really great as well", "so I am mixing a little bit in there", "you can choose which one you want", "and then I am going to pour that into a spray bottle", "and then you want to keep that in the refrigerator it lasts for several weeks to a month", "and you can spray that for a cooling and also healing spray during the summer months last but certainly not least", "we have a cooling foot and leg butter great for this summer", "I am starting with 100 pure mango butter and organic virgin coconut oil", "so I am using a double boiler to go ahead and melt this till they are melted completely together after it has had a chance to cool down", "I am adding a few drops of vitamin E oil and again a few drops of eucalyptus tea tree and peppermint", "you want to be careful with essential oils not to add too much because then it is really really overpowering so", "a drop or two is plenty of each", "and then I am going to whip this up in my blender so that is why can use a hand mixer I am using my KitchenAid which", "I am sure my husband appreciates because he uses that for cooking", "and I use it mostly for skincare", "but hey that is how you get a nice whipped body butter a foot butter in this case", "I actually let this mixture kind of start to harden", "but it did not quite Harden as you can see it was at the beginning process", "but I am going to mix this up real good", "and you will have a fluffy whipped cooling foot and leg butter for the summer months", "these recipes are so yummy and perfect for the summer months", "so that is why am really hoping you guys enjoyed these", "and you try out one of them or two of them", "or however many you get a chance to make", "and you enjoy them as much as I did thank you so much for watching my channel if you like my

beach", "I try to pack the essentials for the entire family snacks water and cool drinks", "are essential so that is why bring a cooler and a little lunch box to store everything in", "so I am starting with some lemon water", "you can make some lemonade if you want", "but I am putting lemon water in a glass bottle", "and then I am also going to bring a few water bottles so that everybody has plenty of h2o", "so one thing I recommend is to use a divided container to pack fresh fruits and veggies I am cutting up some cucumber I am going to have some strawberries some blueberries some carrots", "all of our favorites and", "I am going to put it in a bpa free devided container", "you can get a generic one for like 2 99 at the store and this is a great way to pack fresh fruits and veggies in general when you are going out but especially when you go to the beach along with snacks", "I always like to pack a sandwich as well so that is why am packing a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for Oliver sometimes if you get hungry meals by the beach are not cheap", "so it is good to pack a sandwich for whoever you think might want one one tip", "I love to do before we leave for the beach", "is to make some DIY aloe vera ice cubes for cooling the skin when you return from the beach and they are easy you can just keep them in the freezer and use them if needed these are also great to have around during the summer and all you need is aloe vera and some ice cube trays", "so that is why am taking some aloe vera squeezing it into ice cube trays", "and then I am going to stick those in the freezer", "they will be ready to go by time you get back now", "I am going to go ahead and pack our little lunch pail", "I have some ice packs that went in there plenty of water the lemon water the fresh fruits and veggies", "and then I am going to pack some dried snacks", "I have some dried cherries we get those from a really great vendor at the farmers market packing the sandwiches",

some of our favorite Apple sauces fruit leathers and pretzels whatever I think anybody might be craving once we get to the beach", "I have some nut bars", "and you d be surprised how many snacks you will need it never seems to be enough so that is why am packing that up", "and then I am going to start packing my beach bag", "I always pack a hat when I go to the beach and especially now", "since I have been getting a little melasma during this pregnancy I am also going to be packing some towels and some tapestry", "I get my tapestry on eBay for like between six to eight dollars", "so definitely do not overspend on tapestry", "you can find great little tapestry beach towels on eBay for super cheap and they work perfect for the beach and then of course the essentials are face wipes I have these Hawaiian detox towelettes", "I love the smell of these these work great for removing makeup but also for face wipes", "hand wipes", "they are amazing", "I love them", "I am also going to be packing some facial sunscreen I have the fragrance free SPF 30 sunscreen", "I am going to apply a little bit on my face before I leave but make sure to reapply once you get to the beach alba botanica products", "are cruelty free they contain no synthetic parabens sulfates or artificial colors", "they are hypoallergenic products and not sticky", "so I am happy to support them", "plus I love their sunscreens", "their Hawaiian sunscreen spray is amazing SPF 50", "you just reapply it throughout the day", "and we got zero sunburns", "I also recommend packing a ziploc bag because sometimes before you get in the car on the way home", "we have some wet clothes it is nice to put those in the ziplock bag and an extra pair of clothes", "so I am packing a shirt and some shorts for Oliver and then an extra dress for me in case something gets wet or you get soaked and you want a different pair of clothes so that pretty much completes everything I pack in my beach bag", "now it is time to pack up the car one tip I highly recommend", "is to line the back of your trunk or backseat with a few towels or a sheet especially if you are worried about getting sand everywhere", "our car is not always perfectly clean so it is a lot a huge deal", "but I still line it with a few towels and it makes it easy to kind of clean up once you get back a hack that I love for the beach", "is to use a pop up laundry container for beach toys at first", "I was not sure how much I would love this", "but I like it", "because you can put the beach toys in there you can carry it easily to and from the beach", "and then you can shake out all the sand", "so it is a great way to store beach toys and you can also just wash them directly in the mesh container and it will dry", "so that is why love that we of course pack our chairs", "and I put my beach bag in the back along with our cooler and then an umbrella", "and we are ready to hit the beach so you may have heard of this hack before this is not an original", "but it is to use a fitted sheet and", "basically you just want to put something to hold it down on each end so that is why have the cooler on one end", "I have our beach bag on the other", "and then I have the chairs on the other ends", "and it takes a little bit to maneuver my husband", "did help me with this to get it started", "but then once you get it up and running it is actually a really great hack", "and I love it for the beach we are reapplying sunscreen once we get there", "try not to miss any spots and I love spray sunscreen because it is just a lot less messy in my opinion", "another tip that I love for the beach is an inflatable blow up pool and you put some water in there", "it is great for toddlers and when our Sun that we are expecting in the next few weeks is born next summer I will definitely use this as well because hopefully he can sit up and play with his little toys", "but it is also perfect for my three year old he playing around with his toys", "and you can put water in there and monitor them", "and it has a little cover in case", "they need shade here", "is the 8 tapestry making its appearance love it", "I put that out", "and then I set out

clearance section", "obviously I am wearing bigger pajama pants", "and I would normally work because my size fluctuates from the beginning and middle of my pregnancy and also after I have a baby", "so

a bottle", "I plan to breastfeed exclusively at first", "but I like to have this in case I did not like the formula that they gave Oliver in the hospital last time because they had to give him some formula while he was in the hospital for jaundice long story short", "I want to bring my own hoping for best case scenario but always good to be prepared I am bringing some soothing gel pads for sore

a DIY postpartum herbal fix bath", "a sitz bath is basically a combination of herbs and sea salt and you use it in the bath", "and it is great for healing you know that whole area down there", "after you have had a baby and historically women were encouraged to take a rest period after they had a baby and six baths are really healing", "so that is why can buy a sitz bath herbal packets if you want", "but you can also make them for a fraction of the cost", "so that is why have several different herbs here", "I have sea salt lavender plantain leaf witch hazel yarrow calendula chamomile", "and I will put the exact measurements below", "but basically I am making and mixing them together", "I am going to put them in basically like a little tea bag", "and then you can put them in the bath and sit in a warm bath after having a baby", "and it is really going to help you heal again you can buy these", "and if you do not have time to make them yourself or you can actually make this basket for someone else and leave it at their house", "and it is really helpful to have that", "so that is why am making a few and then putting that in a ziploc bag that is going to go in the post part of the basket", "you can find bath herbs on Amazon", "I actually that company Earth Mama where I got the nipple butter and also the bottom spray they also have bath herbs and then you can buy those if you want and put them in the basket", "also another thing that is great for the basket besides a sitz bath or bath herbs are pads because you will bleed for several days after you also want a bottle of squirt bottle medicated pads", "as well preparation H is another one that will go in there and bringing it to the hospital with me but also in the postpartum basket", "and then I have some nipple pads as well for leaking", "and then the DIY herbal sits back as well", "so that is why have several babs you can take to relax and heal also", "dermal Plast is a numbing spray for down there that is

time", "and I love", "and I think they are called gone bananas and you keep them in the freezer and", "they are basically just chocolate covered frozen bananas", "and I love it", "so basically all you need is just one banana or two if you want to make more I am slicing it up", "and then I am going to freeze that for about an hour hour and a half", "and then I am going to start making the chocolate mixture", "this is pretty easy", "and it is a crowd favorite even if you do not like the texture of bananas traditionally sometimes", "when they are frozen they take on a different texture", "so a lot of times people who do not like bananas will like them when they are chocolate covered frozen bananas so you could always try it and see what you think", "but they are so good", "so that is why am going to freeze those for an hour hour and a half", "then I am going to start making the chocolate", "now I am melting some chocolate chips with a little bit of coconut oil so that is why can use regular chocolate chips", "I have some dairy free chocolate chips right here", "these ones", "I really like I have used them in several of my recipes", "and then I am going to go ahead and melt that together once it is completely melted I have a double boiler here", "so that is why have the water boiling underneath", "and then a bowl on top that is usually how I go about melting it", "but you can of course put that in the microwave", "if that is easier for you or whatever is more convenient we want to it is completely melted and then after an hour and a half of the bananas being in the freezer by themselves going to pull it out", "and you are going to dip each individual banana in the chocolate and completely coat it and cover it", "and then put it back on the sheet", "and then once you have coated all of the bananas you are going to let those freeze again for another four hours or so once they are done freezing you can put them into a bowl however many you want and they make a fabulous treat they go really quickly around here because everybody likes them", "and they are very easy to make in such a crowd pleaser", "so that is why hope you try these out", "and I hope you like them", "as well you", "a snack we live around here is dried fruit and we love to pick up dried apples at the farmers market but they are actually pretty easy to make and inexpensive to make at home",

degrees and these are going to bake in the oven for about 90 minutes", "but before I put them in the oven I am just going to put some coconut sugar on top of them and a little bit of cinnamon you can put stevia if you want or sugar whatever you have brown sugar", "and then I am going to pop those in the oven for 90 minutes", "and then once they have had a chance to cook for 90 minutes", "you can even keep them in the oven for several hours to give them a chance to dehydrate they are almost the texture and consistency of a fruit leather everyone who tried these liked them", "so they are a crowd pleaser kids love them too", "and they are great to pack for on the go for lunches as a snack as a little dessert whatever you want them for but try them out", "and hopefully you like them as much as we did shaved", "ice is super popular in the summertime", "and we were actually out and about recently at an event and", "my son was having some shaved ice", "and I thought I wonder if I should make something a little bit of a healthier version", "I mean shaved ice is not like necessarily the healthiest thing anyway", "but maybe something that does not have as much junk in it", "so that is why took my Vitamix", "I have some ice that I put in my Vitamix which that will definitely turn it into shaved ice", "I am putting that in a container", "and then I have grape juice concentrate", "so it comes in a concentrate", "and then you add a significant amount of water to make the grape juice instead of adding water you are going to put the concentrate I put it in a little squeezy container here", "and I am just putting that directly over the shaved ice you can use the cherry flavor or the lemonade flavor whichever flavor you prefer", "and it is a great little treat for kids", "and they do think it is shaved ice Oliver was so stoked about this", "and it you know grape juice is a little messy so that is why was trying to avoid too much of a mess", "but he was stoked",

bit of coconut sugar to sweeten it up a little bit you can add", "agave stevia whatever you want to your choice and", "the Vitamix is great because it definitely mixes a lot better than my magic

quarter of the way up maybe almost close to halfway up of the jar before I decide to finish", "and then I have some gardenia candles they have candles at the dollar store these ones are from Target or", "you can find them for really cheap at HomeGoods", "and then you can put whatever kind of candle you prefer inside these candle holders", "and I think they look great especially for the summertime they cost little to nothing to make about a dollar fifty maybe even less a piece", "and I am going to use these for our table scape or", "you can put them anywhere around the house next", "we are going to customize a large tin vase I found at HomeGoods", "now you can keep this plain and simple and a lot of people might prefer that I got this idea off of either Etsy or Pinterest", "I ca not remember someone was either selling it on Etsy", "or I saw it on Pinterest and someone had the word fresh on a tin vase like this so that is why looked at that and thought I could do that pretty easy so that is why got a stencil", "and I have a sponge paintbrush", "and then some chalk paint the key here", "is to take a tiny bit of paint and then gently push it onto the stencil so that it does not bleed and if you mess up you can always go in there with a little bit of water and a thin paint brush and clean it up or if you mess it up really bad take a baby wipe and wipe it off and start over fresh", "I mean no pun intended", "I have had a thing lately for Reese", "so we are going to make a citrus wreath for the summertime", "I have some fake plants here", "I got at the dollar store", "I also have the frame from the dollar store and the bigger lemons are from the dollar store", "now the smaller ones are from Michaels", "you can buy those with a coupon for pretty cheap", "and then I am going to make a fake wreath", "now you can use real herbs and plants and I have made a real herbal wreath before which is pretty", "but it dies pretty quick", "and you can use real lemons as well", "but it is also going to be a little heavy", "and it might not stay in your door so going shake", "is going to allow it to last a little bit longer", "and so that is why am starting by cutting up the fake plant", "and then I am using the wire to start attaching it to the frame here", "and I like all of it to go in the same direction because it makes the wreath look a lot nicer", "so that is why am going to start stacking that I am also going to take my hot glue gun and if needed I am going to glue gun some of the fake plant together so that it looks fuller and looks a little bit better now what I am done with that if I have any empty spaces or", "I am feeling like an area is not as full you can add the fake lemons there now like I said it is best to use fake lemons instead of real because it is going to last longer", "and it is a lot less heavy", "and so that is why sometimes it is nice to do a fake wreath instead of a real one", "so that is why am going to go ahead and hot glue gun the big ones and the small ones", "and you know look at it with your own eyes and go according to your own aesthetic and how you like it", "you can add more or less", "and you can totally customize it", "this works great for your door for the summer", "but I also really like it as a centerpiece", "and I will show you that in a little bit so even though I do think it looks nice on the door", "I think it looks even better in the center of the table", "and then I am going to put the fresh vase that I made inside of the wreath", "and then I am going to put some flowers inside the vase", "now there is a few ways you can go about this", "you can just put some greenery some plants by itself", "some people may or may not like that you might want to add a little color you could add tulips by themselves or", "even just some pretty there is so many things you could do you", "could put cherry blossoms in there", "you could put regular flowers in there or you can add it all together which is what I am going to do here because the more the merrier", "and I think it looks pretty", "so I am going to put the green leafy plants with the tulips", "so two of us were a gift someone gave to me", "and so I am happy to be able to use them in this vase", "I think it looks pretty how it kind of drapes so that is why am putting that in the center now if you are going to have people over and you are worried that it is too tall of course when you have dinner you can move it", "but it is really nice when you have guests over when they first arrive to have a table scape you can also go for a minimalist or simplistic look by omitting the wreath altogether and having the vase by itself with some flowers in there", "and then I am going to be adding the candles on either side of the vase", "and I am going to light those up", "and then I am going to set the table", "now we are going to jazz up our napkins", "a little bit make them look summery I am using the same rope that I used for the DIY candle holders", "and I am going to", "wrap that around the napkin make a little knot", "and then I am going to take some herbs from the garden I love working with herbs", "actually did a DIY herbal video with herbs from the garden making a bunch of different DIYs so that is why am taking some fresh rosemary I am sticking that inside the knot I also have some baby flowers from the garden and a little bit of lavender", "so that is why can do whatever you want you can also put name cards if you want directly on the napkin or", "you can put them in front of the plate", "and I think this is really pretty for like a tea party maybe an outdoor dinner that you are going to have or a summer night dinner if you are having guests over and so those are a few little easy DIYs that you can do", "and I am going to set the table", "and I think it brings a lot of color", "and it is a nice presentation for when you have guests over you want to do something a little extra special so that completes this

is video", "I am doing a summer self care habits video even if you ca not implement all of these habits trying to incorporate one or two of them into your routine can make a big difference I did want to let you know first and foremost that this video is a collaboration with Perricone MD so for the facial portion of this video I will be featuring their new amazing h2 elemental energy skincare line so without further ado let is jump right into the video a habit that I highly recommend", "and I have mentioned before in my channel", "is diffusing essential oils", "it is something that is uplifting and a great way to start your morning grapefruit orange or lemon", "are really uplifting sense but my favorites lately have been lavender and vanilla together", "so I will turn that on and it diffuses into the air you can also find a diffuser like this one at the dollar store we put a candle like a tea light candle in the bottom", "and then the oil on top there are a variety of different type of diffusers that you can purchase the first one diffuses cool mist into the air mixing with the essential oils", "this one heats up the oil more like a candle but either way essential oils are a great way to start your morning", "the next tip is to take a social media break and read some self care books it is easy to get distracted for hours and hours on end with screen time whether it is television or social media", "and sometimes it is just nice to unplug", "I established screen time limits for my son", "so sometimes it is kind of nice to do the same thing for yourself", "and then I have some books of this particular book by dr", "Perricone", "I actually rented from the library 10 years ago when I was getting married", "and I did his meal plan for healthy skin before I got married", "I ended up buying that book", "several years ago I go through all the time flip through it", "I always get great ideas", "I also like this Urban remedy books for juicing it has really great self care tips and", "honestly healthy is another book I like for their recipes", "so that is why love to flip through different books and Pinterest is another great place to seems to be a more positive environment sometimes you can get lost on social media or sometimes you end up on a feed that you do not want to be on or", "you know you can kind of mess with your day", "another book", "I like is this a Wilder life book", "it is really lovely", "I have gotten a lot of gardening tips and cooking with things in your garden and how to grow different herbs and vegetables and it also has really great recipes and different tips", "the next thing is to enjoy some time outdoors so whether that is a hike or just walking around the neighborhood or for me gardening", "I like to go out and garden while my son plays outside and he loves that time to play", "and I love that time to kind of tend to my garden now with all of these tips", "you ca not do it every single day", "but it is nice to get outside especially in the summer months when you can get a little bit of vitamin D a little bit of Sun", "it is a little harder in the winter but spending some time outdoors is uplifting in my opinion a self care habit", "I talk about a lot", "is staying hydrated this one is hard for me so that is why have like water tracking bottles they also have water tracking apps where you can just literally put in how much water you had or coffee or tea", "I tend to drink too much iced tea and not enough water especially in the summer", "so another good way to get water in is to chop up fruits and veggies that contain a lot of water like watermelon and pineapple", "so I chopped it up ahead of time", "stick it in the refrigerator so that is why have something healthy to reach for and also it has a lot of water so that I am staying hydrated and healthy during the summer months", "a self care habit that I feel is really important", "is finding a no fuss routine that works for you personally and your skin type now everyone skin care needs are slightly different", "but I do recommend in addition to a consistent routine to do a weekly or bi weekly facial as possible whenever you have time now", "these products specifically help target dehydrated skin that is also lacking energy so that is why am putting my hair up putting a headband on I am starting by cleansing my skin", "it is very important to cleanse the skin thoroughly before steaming and applying skin care and you can find a cleanser like this one that removes all makeup including eye makeup", "but it is also gentle and really softens the skin you definitely do not want", "a cleanser that makes your skin feel dry and tight after using it a facial steamer works great", "but you can also use a bowl with hot water", "you place your head over the water just above it and allow it to steam gently to soften your skin then it is time for a mask I am using the firming foam mask", "this is the perfect 5 minute mask that instantly makes your skin energized and hydrated", "I find foam masks to be fun they start off as a gel it puffs out with this one you can feel the tingling and then upon removal you can instantly see the result the science behind skincare always really fascinates me and the technology behind this", "is that it harnesses the smallest molecule hydrogen penetrates the skin and then gives it a boost of hydration so if your skin is feeling really dehydrated especially in the summer months with the heat and swimming in pools you want something that feels lightweight but still makes your skin feel hydrated so that is why am going to follow up the mask treatment with some hydrating serum and serum always comes after a mask but", "before a moisturizer this serum gives an intense boost of hydration so you can instantly see plumping and smoothing on your skin", "and finally I am going to follow up with the Perricone lightweight fragrance free moisturizer", "this is called the hydrating cloud cream so it has a nice lightweight texture this will help you stay hydrated throughout the day especially if you tend to have combination oily or normal to oily skin types which those skin types can also feel dehydrated as well so", "a lightweight moisturizer like this that hydrates your skin but does not weigh it down or make it feel sticky is a perfect option I am going to finish off the treatment with their D puffing eye cream", "this is perfect for tired moms students and also this is a great one to keep in the refrigerator for the summer months I have done my fair share of DIY bath salts and folks on my channel", "but if you just pick up some epsom salts at the drugstore for a few dollars put some epsom salts in your bath and let it soak it will help with tense or sore tired muscles I tend to take cooler baths on the summer and when I am pregnant obviously I ca not take baths over 90 degrees anyway so even clear baths that can be relaxing then finally after you finish your facial and you have had", "a good soak try to get to sleep get", "a good night is sleep even if that means going to sleep a little bit early", "I know that is crazy to think", "but if you can one thing I like to do is in the summer", "I am not so much drinking hot tea at night", "but I will make some chamomile iced tea or you can make camomile iced tea popsicles which are yummy too", "so basically I am brewing up some chamomile tea I have two teabags", "I added a little bit of agave you could add honey", "and then I am pouring these", "I did this earlier in the day pouring these into my popsicle makers", "and then you can also make chamomile iced tea which is nice", "it still has the relaxing benefits even though it is not hot but in those hot summer months when you do not want to have hot tea especially after bath you can drink the chamomile tea and you can drink that while you are in the bath as well while you are soaking in your Epsom salts and try to get a good night", "is sleep try to get to sleep early and relax and even if you ca not do every single one of these self care habits try implementing a few one or two into your routine and see if you notice a difference

every time I make them the recipes are a little bit different", "so let is jump in and make some special recipes for this coming summer first recipe is for our feet", "and we are making a lime and mint foot soak this", "is pretty easy to make all you need is epsom salts epsom salts work great when you are taking a bath", "but you can also make a fabulous foot scrub or foot soak with Epsom salts I am adding some baking soda and then some lime zest that is going to give it a nice scent", "and then I am going to add a little tiny bit of peppermint essential oil", "now there are different views on using essential oil as well pregnant so if you are pregnant or breastfeeding be sure to check with your personal doctor or physician as made sure to get all the ones that I personally use approved by them", "but everybody has different opinions", "so be sure to check with yours", "I am adding a few drops of peppermint", "then I am going to use a funnel to put this into a glass jar", "now you can keep this for up to a week", "I like to keep it in the refrigerator without the lime desk you can keep it for months and months and months because the baking soda Epsom salt and pepper mint oil does not really go bad so that is why can omit the lime zest and keep it for a lot longer", "but the line gives it a nice scent I am preparing a foot bath with a large bowl some warm water and some river rocks now", "the reason for the river rocks is so that my feet do not slip and slide", "and it also prevents the Epsom salt from pooling at the very bottom of the bowl", "now the flowers are for fun so it looks pretty for the video", "and I am going to put some of the soap inside of the water and basically allow my feet to soak for about 15 minutes your feet are being shown a lot more in the summer", "and it is nice to have nice smooth feet", "so that is why are making a Himalayan salt and honey foot scrub very easy adding some Himalayan salt some coconut oil and a few drops of chamomile essential oil", "so I am removing my feet from the water after the soak", "I am going to take a little bit of the scrub and go ahead and give my feet a nice scrub focusing on the heels anywhere that you notice that you get the calluses and I am going to scrub scrub scrub scrub scrub and then put it back in the water to soak for another minute", "or so remove any extra scrub and then dry off your feet with the towel I like to lay a towel below the bowl so that I do not get water everywhere", "and it also gives me a place to dry off my feet now let is focus on the hands we are making a warm vanilla hand scrub very easy I have made similar scrubs before but not this exact one I have some sugar here", "you could use brown sugar if you want", "and then I am using coconut oil", "I have about a tablespoon of coconut oil and then just a few drops of vanilla essential oil now if you do not have vanilla essential oil you can also use some vanilla extract if you want a drop", "and you can use this all over your body if you want", "but I am focusing on the hands", "so I am going to take this scrub and", "I am just going to scrub my hands", "I am also going to go up my arms to what is really nice about this one", "is the coconut oil is hydrating so", "even after you wash it out you can still feel a little bit of the leftover coconut oil on your arms and your hands", "it feels really nice", "finally we are making a multi purpose hand in futsal", "this is great for severely dry hands and feet and", "so that is why am using a double boiler and the situation I am actually putting the measuring cup directly in the pot", "and then I am going to add some coconut oil", "I also have some beeswax and I am going to be adding some olive oil as well now I am keeping the heat relatively low because the key here is to allow it to melt but not overheat it", "and then once it is had a chance to completely melt I am going to take it off", "and then I am going to add some vitamin E and some essential oils", "I am adding about five to six drops of vitamin E and then a few drops of frankincense and lavender frankincense is extremely healing and lavender is also plus it smells nice so that is why am going to put that into a jar and then allow it to harden completely overnight you can use this whenever you want", "but", "I also recommend using it with hydrating gloves and socks", "you can find those on Amazon", "but they work great for a very dehydrated skin and sometimes that happens in the summer when you are walking around barefoot or you are walking around with sandals that can dry out your feet so use this in combination with some gloves sleep with it overnight for really hydrated soft skin you can also use it on areas that are dry like your elbows or your knees so feel free to use it wherever you think you need it so that completes this video", "I hope you enjoyed if you like my channel", "please be sure to hit the subscribe button for new videos every week and make

going to show you guys how I am reorganizing my craft closet", "this was actually highly requested because a lot of you want to know where I keep all my craft and my DIYs after I finished them over the last several years as I have started doing a lot more DIYs on my channel and crafts and different things", "I have collected my fair share of craft supplies and different things so that is why have a closet in my hallway where I keep all that", "and I usually try to keep it pretty organized", "but I wanted to film this video and before I film this video it had gotten out of control as you can see everything had kind of been thrown back in there", "and I definitely put it on my list of things that I needed to organize ASAP because it was driving me crazy so the first thing I did was categorize and organize whether it is my closet it is a drawer that has gotten out of control something in my bathroom whenever I am organizing I usually take everything out and reassess what I have", "and then I decide if I need to donate or throw anything away if something is old if there is like old paint or markers that do not work anymore I go through and reassess a lot of times if I am doing a crafter filming a video I get distracted with my son or something comes up", "and then I put it back in there", "and I do not get a chance to put it away where it belongs and over the course of time things do get cluttered", "so that is why try to make it a priority to get around to organizing different areas of my house", "but it is not always organized at all times because it is impossible", "and so I try to make it a priority to do it so", "what I did here was", "I took everything out", "assessed what I had what was old what needed to be thrown away", "I have craft and DIY storage boxes", "they are basically plastic boxes that you can get at Target I categorized by fabrics you can categorize", "however you want", "but I have so many different types of crafty items that I want to save and reuse", "so that is why kind of tried to put little accessories and one fabrics and another glitter and little", "you know like these eyeballs and different things", "and then I labeled", "so that is why actually already had some of these labeled", "and I did try to go along with whatever labels around the boxes", "so that is why did not have to take them out and redo them again", "this is the adhesive box", "so that is why can just go based on your collection", "what you have however big or small", "your collection is", "mine has grown", "and so I definitely need to I have them labeled properly because the idea is that when you are done with something you put it back in the appropriate labelled box again that does not always happen around here", "sometimes I get in a hurry and like throw it in there", "but the idea of labeled boxes is obviously to stay organized and put everything back in their appropriate boxes sometimes if the boxes are overfilled it will prevent you from being able to put it back appropriately", "so I wanted to eliminate some of the shoe boxes that were overfilled", "I got a very large drawer plastic box from Target", "and then these little mason jars from the dollar store in the mason jars I put markers pens and pencils", "and then I also put these paint brushes and sponges and then in that same drawer I decided to put the various paints that I had", "and I did try to organize it from largest to smallest", "so the large ones are all the way in the back", "and then the small ones up front", "so all of my painting items instead of being in multiple shoeboxes they all went in this drawer box so that is why am going to try that out", "see how that works and then for my ribbons I was previously hanging my ribbons on the side of the closet door", "but then I was noticing when I would open up the door that one or two of them would fall so that is why decided to switch that up", "that was not really working", "I decided to get one of these caddies from Target", "you usually find these in like the bathroom section", "and so you can put your ribbon in there and put a little bit of ribbons through each of the holes", "and then you can see the ribbon that you have", "and you can even pull the ribbon and cut it right there", "so this was a better way to organize my ribbon", "so then it was time to put everything back", "and it looks so much more organized", "I filmed this video a little bit back because I am trying to get a head start", "so that is why can take some time off when I have a baby", "and it has stayed organized", "and I have been trying to be good about putting everything in its box", "I did categorize all the boxes according to what I had", "so i had planner accessories and paper fabric and stickers and then miscellaneous", "so i categorized i put all the paints paint brushes in the drawer", "and then obviously the ribbon I do seasonal DIYs on my channel", "and you guys are always asking where I store them if I like them and want to keep them after I finished them I will store them in my seasonal boxes which are basically big plastic boxes that are also labeled and they are seasonal so that is why have Christmas ones so the Christmas ribbon and all the seasonal type things go in those boxes", "and if I have DIYs some of the DIYs they really stand the test of time", "and I would say I keep a majority of them", "but I keep them in their appropriate seasonal box so if there are summer DIY that I want to keep I put it in the summer box if it is a Christmas one", "I will put it in the Christmas Box and then sometimes I will have leftover DIY accessories that are also seasonal so I will put those in the boxes and as you can see I put the boxes up on the top and", "then the Rees", "I need to get a special container for the reefs but for", "right now I put them on top of one of the boxes", "and then I label them again spring summer fall and winter", "and that is kind of

why thought I would do one testing out a bunch of new Diddy", "is and let you guys know what the heck they do", "so that is why am starting first with this coconut oil hot oil treatment", "my mom got this for me from Hawaii when she went to Hawaii", "brought it home as a gift", "so it says to stick it in the microwave", "but I just put it in a teacup with hot water for about 10 minutes", "got it nice and hot", "and then I am going to put it in a squeeze bottle", "I am normally not one to buy a hot oil hair treatment at the store because I find that they usually have other fillers and ingredients", "and I d rather use pure coconut oil which I do a lot probably once or twice a month", "but this one was clean", "and I had a few other ingredients in it", "it has biotin and a few other hair superfoods", "so that is why", "and I think you it is not just something you can find in Hawaii", "you can get it at Ulta or other beauty stores", "but my mom picked it up for me if you have a dry scalp I would recommend applying it onto your scalp and then massaging it in and", "then if you have an oily scalp you are going to apply it from your ears down and then focus on your ends", "if you have split ends if you color your hair try to do a hot oil treatment this one or with coconut oil try to do it once a week I do not always get a chance to do it", "but I like to saturate my hair in the coconut oil and then a lot of times I will keep it on overnight", "and it really helps your hair look shiny and healthy", "you do not have anywhere to go every once in a while", "the UPS guy will like come to my door and I will answer it with coconut oil in my hair", "and I think at this point he just knows that I am a little bizarre", "I am just kidding", "so I mean you just kind of look greasy", "so I saturate my hair with it", "I am going to put my hair in a braid and then just kind of pin it back into a little bun", "it is not the cutest look", "but you will look good after you wash it up the next day", "I promise", "and then I am going to play a headband on", "and I am going to start my skincare treatments", "and I am going to start by washing my face", "so with my cleanser I am going to use an ultrasonic spatula", "this is a crazy device it is been used on me before and facials in the past I had a few friends who were estheticians who use this on me during facials this was actually sent to me", "I did not buy this", "but I am one to definitely collect my fair share of skincare and skincare tools and", "this is definitely an interesting skincare tool that they do use in professional spas and", "when you are getting facials so it has one side that is a scrubbing side and a setting to go with that side", "and then it has another side that is an infusing side to use with serum", "so that is why can use the exfoliating side with your cleanser great for enlarged pores blocked pores and just deep exfoliation in general and you will notice brightening after using it consistently", "I am going to use a sheet mask I like to keep sheet masks in the refrigerator", "these are new", "my mom also got me this when she went to Hawaii", "so I have not had a chance to try these", "so I ca not say what I think about them", "I like to try out different sheet masks I do not use them that often but", "whenever I get a chance or", "I have them around", "I will use them if I am going to give myself a facial", "it is nice to keep these in the refrigerator in the summer for a nice cooling facial also in the final weeks of my pregnancy which I am in the final weeks of my pregnancy", "I tend to retain a lot of water and get kind of puffy", "so it is nice to have a cooling sheet mask on my skin to help the puffs going to leave it on for 10 minutes", "then I am going to take it off", "I look especially glamorous with the sheet mask and oil in my hair", "and then there is some extras in there", "so that is why am going to stick those back in the refrigerator", "and then there is always a little leftover of the treatment on my skin after I have used a sheet mask so that is why am actually going to use the other side of the spatula so this side is for infusing serums", "or you know", "right now like there is a treatment I have left over from the mask and basically it uses that ultrasonic technology to push the product deeper into your skin so that you get even better results", "so when you apply serums manually they are not going to get as deep into the skin as they will with an ultrasonic technology like this", "so it is kind of like a Clarisonic similar", "but it has two functions it has the scrubbing function", "and then the infusing function", "so there is lots of facials professional facials that use this spatula", "but there is so many different options", "when you are getting a facial depending on what your skin care needs are another thing I like is a facial massage err if you do not want to invest in crazy tools like the ones I show on my channel you can invest in something like this which is a dollar or two dollars", "this one is from ELF", "and it is a facial massage err you can use this with a serum so after you apply a facial serum you can use this", "now I am going a little fast", "you are actually supposed to go a little slower than this", "but this is going to bring blood flow to the skin it is going to make your cheeks look a little rosy so it is healthy to bring that blood flow to your skin and also help infuse the serum deeper into your skin now I am going to use a deep puffing a gel", "and I am going to use that in combination with facial cooling globes these I did buy off of Amazon", "and again it is for deep puffing", "it is also great for relieving sinus pressure if you have puffy eyes headaches or migraines and also to reduce inflammation so if you are getting a facial and an esthetician notices any of these types of things he or she might use facial cooling globes to kind of resolve those issues you do want to use it with a serum so that they glide a little bit smooth but these run between twenty to thirty dollars so if you do not want to spend twenty to thirty dollars on facial cooling Globes which I would totally understand you can get these kind of like ice packets for your eyes those run about two dollars you keep them in the freezer", "and they do melt kind of quick after about five minutes they melt", "but you can put these on your eyes", "I use it just to kind of tap around my eye area if you have a headache or inflammation anywhere", "these are great as well", "and you can lay down sit back in a bath or lay down in your bed and put these on your eyes and", "they are nice they are a nice source of relief if you have a sinus headache or experiencing puffiness

kind of wanted to take you through how I clean my house for the most part starting in sections", "so that is why are gonna do floors and how I clean my stainless steel in kitchen", "sink some of these I have gone over in the past in other videos in different context", "but I thought I d put it all in one video just in case", "you are curious and these are satisfying not to film for me because I actually get something done", "but then when I edit it it is very satisfying to watch back because my house is not always clean", "so it is nice to see it in this condition so starting with the floors first", "I recently bought the Bissell", "and I bought this with my own money", "this is not sponsored I am always very open when I have a sponsor for my channel this I bought off of Amazon", "I wanted to get a vacuum that worked on hardwood floors", "I kind of checked a bunch of different things and this one got good reviews or", "it got the best reviews out of a bunch of the ones that I had kind of been looking at", "and so it has two different options it has a hardwood floor kind of sweeper option", "I like it", "my husband is not crazy about it", "he does not think it picks up enough", "but I actually think it works rather well for the hardwood floors", "it does not scratch them and", "it does", "it is kind of like dusting and also sweeping", "but it kind of does all the work for you", "so I try to do this once a day", "and then I switch it to the other setting which it has a carpet setting", "and then it has a deeper section", "so for like spills there was like some pretzels on our carpet from my son eating and so if I do this every day my floors definitely look a lot better and it is kind of easy to maneuver", "I like it personally", "so I would highly recommend it", "I am sure with any of these you can kind of find something you love and hate about it", "it has a retractable plug", "and so that is", "why really like that", "and then after I do that which is kind of like dusting and sweeping the floors or vacuuming them", "then I use my shark steam cleaner", "you have to use distilled water with this so that is why do keep a bottle of distilled water to refill it", "and I think it has something to do with not clogging up the machine so that is why just follow the instructions on that one and then", "I also buy extra", "it comes way", "I believe three of the little cotton these guys whatever they are called the little mopping covers", "and I buy extras off of Amazon as well", "so that is why can just throw these in the wash with your whites", "but I like to buy", "I have about six you can buy six refills", "so that is why have nine total and again this is another thing I do not always do it every single day", "but if I vacuum and use my steamer every single day it does make a huge difference in how my house looks so that is why try to do it after Oliver goes to sleep", "and you know I am kind of like tidying up and getting everything clean and", "it does help", "and then I use essential oils", "you are not supposed to put anything in the water", "but I do put a few drops of essential oil on the bottom of the mop cloth I use the steam or the scrub setting rather which is the strongest setting and at first it takes a few passes to really start to see that it is cleaning but as the steam gets rolling", "and it gets going", "it starts working", "well I have tried a bunch of different things for cleaning hard floors and this is by far the most superior cleaning device that I have tried", "so that is why do highly recommend it", "it is a little bit of a cleaning investment if you will", "but I do think it is worth it", "I bought it for myself as a Christmas gift", "I think they run like 100 maybe 120", "but again something I try to use everyday and makes a huge difference so as far as surfaces I keep it pretty simple", "I use the honest multi surface cleaner", "now you can get honest everywhere", "I used to be subscribed to their box", "and i think i have to resub scribe for the diapers when my when my little my little baby is born and then", "I also used the Trader Joe is kitchen claws they are reusable so you can wash them and use them again", "we have Caesarstone in the kitchen and the bathrooms", "so that is what I use for the surfaces of both the kitchen and the bathrooms", "it works well", "it cleans really well and for my windows", "I usually just use the the same company honest", "but I used their window cleaning spray so that is what I use for the surfaces I was finding that I was kind of being a little wasteful with paper towels", "so I definitely try to buy these and then wash them and use them when I clean", "so I just throw them in with their colors", "so I throw them in with one of my color loads", "so next I am going to show you guys how I clean stainless steel", "now I do try to use natural options as often as possible I have yet to find anything natural that works with stainless steel so unfortunately I do use this product here which works well", "but I do not know what is in it", "so that is why use a mask and gloves when I clean with it", "and I open all the windows I am kind of like a little bit probably", "like I do not know maybe a little over paranoid maybe not enough", "I do not know", "but it is a polish that works really well for stainless steel", "it makes all your appliances look brand new", "so I do not clean that often with it I do not have to do it that often it is definitely not a daily thing", "but I take a a towel", "and you use a tiny bit", "and you polish it", "and it makes your refrigerator and any of your stainless steel items look completely brand new and shiny", "so like I said if you know of a natural solution or remedy that works just as good as this I would love to know", "but every once in a while when it comes to my house I always try to find a natural option", "but if I ca not I wear a mask gloves and open up the windows and", "that is what I do so for the stovetop", "I have a flat stovetop", "and I have a product from the same company I get both of them at Target at the same time", "and this is the glass cooktop cleaner or polish", "and I have again tried more natural alternatives for cleaning this", "but this really does the trick", "so that is why do this maybe once a week or every other week just when it is starting to get kind of dingy", "and it does clean it and make it look nice and pretty much brand new so um again if any of you guys know maybe I am missing something", "but I have tried so many different things and these work well for the stovetop and the stainless steel so now moving on to the sink and dishes which again is another daily task I use the pop up sponges from Trader Joe", "is I have shown these before in my channel", "I believe", "and so basically to be a little bit more economical", "I actually cut them in half", "and then they expand with water", "so I like the stainless steel scrubber sponges they work well for cleaning the sink itself and also certain pans you have to be careful because you ca not use it on everything and then like a scrubber brush", "so those are kind of like my kitchen tools", "and then that I use a little bit of water a tiny bit of soap and those pop up sponges to clean out my dishes and stick them in the dishwasher so now for cleaning the sink I use baking soda and the seventh generation cleaning dish soap so that is why put the baking soda first", "and then I put the dish soap on there", "and then I use my scrubber stainless steel brush to scrub scrub scrub I always use my gloves when I do the dishes and when I clean out the sink then when it comes to the disposal", "sometimes I will notice that the sink kind of smells disgusting and one thing that I do like a little hack that I do", "and I have shown it before my channel", "I also have the recipe on my Instagram", "and I believe it is on my blog", "as well it is really easy", "you take an ice cube tray", "you take half vinegar half water", "then you chop up lemon and limes really small you dye some and put it inside the ice cube tray and make these little disposal ice cube tablets", "and I put that in the disposal", "turn the disposal on run it for a few seconds run the water because you always want to have the water running when you are using the disposal", "and then it cleans out the disposal or it gives the disposal and a much nicer smell and", "that is kind of like my daily routine so that is why will do the dishes I will clean out the sink with the baking soda and the dish soap and then use my little tablets that I make", "and I keep those in the freezer and that is how I keep the sink smelling good and looking nice and clean", "so this is kind of like new to my collection", "this is the spot cleaning machine by Bissell", "again totally bought this", "did not get this sent to me", "I am not being sponsored by Bissell or anything although hey this will call me", "I got this stuff", "kidding", "I got this off of Amazon again", "and I got it for my upholstery", "so like my chairs my couch and the carpet whenever there is a stain and there are my fair share of stains because I like the color beige", "and I have a toddler do not ask me what I am thinking", "I do not know", "and I am getting ready to have another one", "but this does work pretty good", "I gotta say it does have like some sort of cleaning solution that it comes with", "it says it is environmentally friendly", "do not really know what that means I am in the process of looking for a little bit more of a natural alternative to put inside but", "as you can see it kind of like steams it or sucks it up with water", "not exactly sure the technology or how it works exactly", "but it does work well for stains on the carpet on the couch and the upholstery chairs so it does the job", "I really like it", "I do not have to use it that often", "but it is great", "to have just in case you get a stain and then last but not least we will talk briefly about laundry the way that I get laundry done is by doing a few small loads every day", "so usually it is one small light load and one small color load", "I use these three in one laundry detergent pods", "I either use this one", "I got these off of Vitacost which is where I order a lot of cleaning supplies and things like that", "or I will use the Tide Pods", "if I am at Target I try to use the white ones they are the free and gentle which I have been using for years I actually did partner with them once on my channel", "but this is not a partnership with them I honestly use that I pick them up at Target every time I go", "or I buy the ones from Vitacost", "so anyway that is kind of like my routine", "hopefully it gave you some tips tricks things you can kind of look into maybe invest in if you like my channel", "please be sure to subscribe", "I do a variety of all sorts of different types of videos and check out my last two videos", "and I will see you guys very soon in the next one", "have a good day bye"], "iN-JQAhNAHo": ["hey guys welcome back to my channel today we are making a few different nice cream recipes", "I have been a huge fan of nice cream recipes", "they are basically just dairy free ice cream to me", "they are more like a sorbet texture but the whole family loves it my son loves it", "so that is why am going to teach you guys", "the recipes that I have been liking the first one is the coffee nice cream super easy to make I have the Khalifah cold brew which by the way that with ice is so good I have a little less than one cup of frozen bananas", "and I am pouring enough cold brew to cover the bananas and literally putting that in my magic bullet and then adding some ice", "and that is it", "you have like the quickest and easiest coffee smoothie if you want or what you can do", "is you can put it in a freezer safe container", "freeze it", "and then you have a really yummy nice cream this has a little bit of caffeine in it", "but I can have a little bit right now", "and it is super yummy", "I am a huge fan of coffee ice cream in general so super easy I am going to pop that in the freezer the next one is raspberry nice cream this one is really good and this one was my son is favorite", "so I am pretty thorough and go with these type of recipes", "I do not necessarily measure specifically so", "that is why have some ice at the bottom I put probably give or take half a cup of frozen bananas some almond milk I am going to", "blend that up until it is completely smooth and creamy", "and then I am going to add frozen raspberries and pulse now", "you can add as much or little as you want of the raspberries you could also do cherry if you want or strawberry if you wanted strawberry instead", "this is more like a sorbet texture", "but it is so good", "and once it kind of freezes up a little bit more it tastes really good", "and you could certainly drink it as a smoothie if you want", "but all of these can kind of double as a smoothie", "but if you freeze them then they become an ice cream", "so I am going to spoon this into a freezer safe container I have like a one serving size container here", "and then I am going to cover it", "these are not overly sweet so if you wanted to add a little bit of agave that could definitely sweeten it up a little bit next we are going to make the chocolate nice cream again starting with the base of ice frozen bananas", "and then I am going to add a little bit of vanilla extract we get this vanilla extract we have got a huge bottle off of Amazon", "we probably wo not need any more for like the next century and then a tablespoon of cocoa powder and then some almond milk to cover it", "and then again we are just going to blend it up", "put it in a freezer safe container and stick it in the freezer last but certainly not least", "we have the peanut butter chip nice cream", "I am a huge fan of peanut butter and chocolate mixed together so again I am starting with frozen bananas", "I have a little bit more frozen bananas this time so again about the same as I did with the first one which was a little less than a cup and then one heaping spoonful of peanut butter", "and then I am going to add some chocolate chips or chocolate nibs so that is why am going to add some almond milk to cover it", "and then some ice now", "if you omit the ice it will be a little tiny bit creamier which I have found through making several different versions of this so that is why could try that but again blending this up putting it in a freezer safe container", "and then it is time for all them to go in the freezer for a few hours till they set up so after they have set up for about four hours", "then you can either eat them individually because these are individual containers or you could take a scoop from each flavor and create a combination of all of them together like I said initially they are a little bit more of a sorbet texture especially if you add ice there will be a little bit more creamy if you omit the ice and freeze them", "I have seen so many different versions of nice creams", "and I wanted to try them out", "but these are the ones that I like they are super easy to make you can make each of them in a few minutes", "and there is something the whole family can enjoy and you can customize and kind of know what goes inside of your dessert so hopefully you guys enjoyed this video", "if you like my videos be sure to subscribe to my channel", "check out my last few videos",

really excellent shampoo and conditioner and then exfoliating body gloves I pretty much used every time I shower with my body wash they run between three to six dollars you can find them at the drugstore or on Amazon", "and I scrub", "my body head to toe for moisturizer I have been using the echo Bella Echo shield number four", "I am a huge fan of the echo Bella products and I used to use

for before you put on your foundation", "but it is also a nice moisturizer", "so that is why use a damp Beauty Blender and I am applying that onto my skin it makes your skin look dewy my skin drinks it up and really loves it", "so then I am going to be using the Charlotte Tilbury magic foundation", "I like this but for the price I probably wo not purchase it again to be completely honest", "I am not the type to stop using a product unless I hate it", "and I do like it", "but I do like to go for like a CC cream", "usually I likes the Too Faced CC cream I was using in the fall", "so that is why

great color", "sometimes you find bronzers that where the color is not as great", "so that is why just apply in areas where the Sun would hit we a bronzing or", "whatever brush I have", "but I will say I did not realize when I purchased this that it is connected or tom 4 is connected with Estee Lauder and", "it is not cruelty free it is not a cruelty free makeup line", "so that is why probably will not repurchase it is going to take me a while to get through it", "but I will probably do a two faced or a Tarte bronzer in the future and not repurchase that one", "but it is", "it is a nice bronzer I will admit for the Kevin of Quan SX I have been using this concealer forever", "it is almost too redundant to repeat", "but I do use a q tip to apply it when I first started my channel", "I feel like I was kind of overdoing the concealer", "maybe that was a look back", "then I do not know", "but I I just put like lit tiniest bit under my eyes down the sides of my nose and anywhere where

embarrassing", "I have been I have been telling myself I am letting them grow out I look back at old pictures", "and I think I ca not believe I tweezed my eyebrows or waxed them so thin", "and now I kind of let them", "I am letting them be free", "and then I am going to seal that with the elf clear eye brow gel", "this is like 1 at Target", "and it also has some clear eye gel for the mascara",

the Tom Ford pussycat lipstick", "I really like this it is like a rosy pink", "I just put a tiny bit on my lips and that is kind of like an everyday lipstick", "I really love this color", "and then I

is kind of frizzy", "I usually have a little bit of frizz and wave right near my hairline right here", "so I pull up the top of my hair and Flatiron", "that", "and I try not to flat iron too much the

sharing to you guys a few recipes that I have been loving lately", "I made these on all different days so nothing went to waste", "but these were lunches with the exception of the acai bowl", "these were lunches that I have been having and they kind of mimic fast food or quick stop restaurants that I like to go to some of my favorite types of foods that I eat", "but these are the at home versions", "so I wanted to share it with you guys and I am going to jump right in", "so let is start first with an acai bowl which you will see these out and about a lot they can be kind of pricey and loaded with a lot of sugar so that is why like to make them at home", "so that is why can monitor that I make mine in a blender with frozen blueberries", "some raspberries frozen bananas and then coconut milk yogurt", "it is basically like an alternative for Greek yogurt", "but you can use Greek yogurt if you prefer I am also going to use some coconut milk", "but again you can use almond milk or regular milk whatever you have and want to put in there", "and then I am going to add some off site powder which I get my acai powder at Whole Foods or at health food stores this lasts a long time if you keep it in the refrigerator", "and you can put it in smoothies", "you can mix it with coconut milk and drink it as is so", "once I blended it", "I am going to pour it into a bowl", "top it with some fresh fruit", "and you can top it with berries if you want or bananas I like shredded coconut", "and you can drizzle a little honey on top if you want", "but I am trying to keep the sugar down and for me I like this as a dessert", "I do not eat it as often in the morning because it does not fill me up but a lot of people do like to have acai bowls in the morning", "and you are going to see them kind of everywhere", "I mean so many different places are selling them", "and they can be pretty pricey", "but you can make them at home for a fraction of the cost", "so next I am making a quinoa salad bowl", "this mimics", "a quinoa salad I like to pick up at a restaurant called low pain pointed on", "hopefully I pronounced that right", "so that is why am starting by cooking up some quinoa", "and then I am going to have a very large bowl filled with tons of freshly washed arugula", "I love arugula", "it is my one of my favorites", "I am topping it with some cherry tomatoes chopping up some cucumbers", "I have some avocado fresh parsley from the garden I am going to put several spoonfuls of the quinoa on top of the salad", "and then I am going to put a few spoonfuls of hummus on top of the parsley", "and then you can top it with some lemons some olive oil a little bit of salt and pepper", "and this is such a delicious salad when you mix it all together", "it is so flavorful", "and you can also make it ahead of time", "bring it to work with you if you want this is the one I do like to go and pick up", "but it is more expensive to buy it at the restaurant", "and I tend to make it a lot bigger at home and for a lot less", "so try it out and see if you like it it is a really good flavor combination and tastes super delicious", "okay", "so next I am making a burrito bowl this one mimics one of my favorite kind of fast food restaurants", "and I am just going to start by roasting up some corn on the stove", "and I am going to set that aside keep it on low to stay warm", "I am also cooking up some black beans", "and then I am going to chop up a little bit of onion", "add some olive oil and add some jasmine rice to the pan", "so this is precooked rice", "you can either do microwave rice if you want", "but I just cooked it in a pan", "and then I am putting it in here", "I am going to add a little bit of cilantro", "and then I am going to cook it up a little bit warm it up", "basically get it nice and brown", "and then keep it on low heat I am also adding a tiny bit of lime to this so that is why have kind of like this lime cilantro rice", "it is very good", "okay", "so that is why am going to set that aside", "and then I am going to quickly whip up some avocado tomatillo salsa you can make this in a blender", "but I am using my magic bullet", "I have one avocado half of a white onion half of a deseeded serrano a pinch of cilantro a large tomatillo one juice of a lime one clove of garlic a pinch of salt and then a little bit of water like between two and four tablespoons of water as needed to give it a salsa texture", "otherwise it will kind of get stuck in the blender", "so I am putting a little tiny bit of water", "and then I am going to blend it up to create our salsa that is going to go on top of the bowl", "so now it is time to assemble our burrito bowl", "the bottom of the bowl is going to be a bed of rice", "so that is why am putting the cooked up jasmine rice at the bottom I am then going to add some roasted corn", "and then I am going to divide it into sections so that is why am going to put some roasted corn some black beans I also have some pico de gallo", "I bought some pico de gallo from the store", "but you can certainly make it at home if you want and you have a recipe", "you like I am going to put that in the middle", "I am going to slice up some avocado put it on top", "it is totally optional but you can add jalapenos if you like that I love spicy so that and some cilantro", "and then I am going to drizzle some of the avocado tomatillo salsa that we made over the top", "and it is so good so delicious", "and it was made at home", "so that is why do not have to go to a fast food restaurant to get it super yummy", "you can make a few of these for the family it is definitely nice and filling a nice sized bowl of food and", "this is one that I am definitely loving last but certainly not least is making a subl", "and I am absolutely obsessed with this I am starting", "I know there is all sorts of different recipes but", "this is kind of the one that I have been doing", "and I adapted it from a recipe I found online", "changed it up a little bit I am chopping up some ginger in half", "and then an onion in half", "and I am going ahead and broiling that you have to keep an eye on anything when it is in the broiler because within a few minutes it will be burned", "and then I am going to toast up some cinnamon coriander and about three to five cloves and basically you are going to toast it until it starts to become fragrant", "you can also see it Browns a little bit", "so I am going to toast up the spices", "and then when those are done I am going to put them inside some cheesecloth", "and I am going to tie it with some cotton twine", "then I am going to pull out my onion and my ginger from the broiler", "and I am going to take about four cups of veggie stock now", "you can use beef stock or chicken stock you can also make it at home if you want maybe I will do a recipe in the future", "but I bought veggie stock from the store so four cups of veggie stock I am going to add the cheesecloth full of spices", "and then I am going to put the full onion and ginger inside of the stock I am going to let that boil", "and then I am going to turn it to a simmer", "let that simmer for about 15 to 20 minutes so that the spices and the ginger and the onion infuse into the stock then I am adding a tablespoon of soy sauce I actually add a little bit more than that because I love soy sauce", "and then I am going to just let that simmer after about 15 to 20 minutes I am going to take out the ginger and the onion and obviously the cheesecloth", "and then I am going to start cooking the noodles", "so these are actually the appropriate noodles", "but I they are more like ramen noodles", "but I really like these rice ramen noodles they are by lotus foods", "and they are gluten free and", "vegan", "I find them on Vitacost comm which is where I get a lot of my dried goods and vitamins and even cleaning supplies and things like that", "I order I usually do a big order once a month off of there", "and then I am just going to let that cook for about three to five minutes I am going to pour that into a large bowl", "and then I am going to start assembling the toppings which I have some lime", "I have some shredded onions I have", "some bean sprouts some fresh basil from the garden", "I have some hoisin sauce some sriracha and this is kind of everything that I put in my bowl", "and then you can kind of put however much you want in there", "I usually either chop up or shred it with my hands the basil and then", "I also have a little bit of green onion", "and then I put tons and tons of lime because I love the lime", "and I do like it spicy", "so that is why put a little bit of sriracha", "a little bit of the hoisin mix it together", "and I got to say this is pretty close to the places that I like to go and get this soup", "I know there are a variety of ways of making this so this might be not the exact way that everybody makes it", "but it tasted pretty good", "and you can do it vegan or you can make it with chicken broth or beef broth", "however you want to make it you can kind of mess around of it", "but I think the point is that you can make it from home so if it is a cold day or you are sick or you are in the mood for this you can certainly make it from home", "and it was super super delicious", "so hopefully you will try this recipe out", "hopefully you enjoy it and that completes this video of a few recipes that I am absolutely loving", "and I enjoy getting and going out and getting", "but also I found it can be made at home too", "so if you like my channel please be sure to subscribe check out my last two videos", "and I will see you guys in the next video bye"], "k9LYo2WAQus": ["hey everyone welcome back to my channel so today I am taking you to my herb garden", "and I am going to give you guys a little tour and share with you guys kind of what we have been doing to grow our garden now", "I will say we are not professional by any means", "and I think when it comes to gardening it is a hobby that you kind of start small", "we had a small little garden", "when we lived in the apartment we had the tiniest little patio balcony and we started with just a few plans", "and then we both became increasingly interested in gardening and just the benefits of it you know cooking with it", "I like to make a bunch of DIYs with the herbs", "so that is why wanted to show you guys a few of the things that have worked for us in growing our garden and some tips and tricks", "so hopefully you guys enjoy this video and I am just going to jump right in", "so I am going to start by giving you a quick tour of our herb garden now the first thing we have", "is the planters we went for some wood planters they just sell these at our local nursery", "and they actually usually put trees in here sometimes herbs", "but we they are like 12 bucks apiece", "we line them and then put the potting soil inside them which I will show you that in a second", "and then we have kind of your more common herbs", "we have sage we have parsley thyme rosemary mint basil", "and today I am going to be adding some oregano to the herb garden", "there are certain plants that like to be around each other and others that do not like to be around each other", "so for the mint we actually moved the mint because it was not doing well", "but then it kind of popped back up here", "so there is a little bit of mint there the rosemary kind of tends to take over wherever it is and grow wild so that is why I pick it and use it a lot for DIYs", "and it seems like the more it is picked", "the more it grows so it is one of those kind of plants that likes to be picked", "and then Oliver made that for us it is a little birdhouse we like to put in the garden so first and foremost try to pick an area that gets at least six hours of sunlight this gets shade in the morning and at night but at least six hours of sunlight in the day after you have chosen a pot or planter", "you want to fill it with high quality organic potting soil and", "then organic fertilizer I am putting about two or three shovel fulls of the fertilizer in", "and then I am going to rake it", "so that is well mixed", "then I am going to give it a nice spritz of water so that it is damp", "so that is why did not start this planter today", "obviously I have a few herbs already growing in there", "but I had some room for more", "so that is why am going to make sure that the soil is nice and damp", "but I have been watering those herbs", "and I just wanted to add a few different ones", "so I am going to spritz it with a little bit of water", "it is nice and wet", "and then you know I am a little bit of an impatient gardener in the sense that you can start with seeds but", "it is going to take a lot longer", "and I like to transplant", "so that is why can head to the nursery or Home Depot", "and you can get a plant like this", "I am going to cut that little plastic ring around", "so you want to dig a hole big enough to fit your herbs obviously all the roots are covered and that it is nice and snug in there", "so that is why am kind of moving around a little bit of the soil", "you still have some more room in this planter to and maybe one or two", "you want to bunch them close together", "but not too close together so that they do have a chance to grow and kind of spread out a little bit", "so also I like to kind of group the herbs by delicate spring herbs which are more like chives parsley dill and tarragon and then hearty Mediterranean herbs", "so we also have a few dwarf citrus trees that we keep on our patio", "and they are also in planters", "we have grapefruit lemon lime and orange", "these can be contained and also grow in a sunny area that gets at least six hours of Sun", "so you can certainly grow them in a planter or a pot for my understanding citrus likes to be fed", "so that is why do give it citrus food about once a month", "and this is a you can find a citrus fertilizer", "and so that is why am adding a little bit of that into the soil mixing it up", "and then it does take a while for these to start bearing fruit I recommend becoming friendly with somebody at your local nursery and chatting with them and talking with them about how you can best take care of your trees and your plants and your herbs as you can see we have some lemons here that are growing some of the leaves are turning yellow which means that I need to be watering more and", "I also need to be feeding it more and I obviously fed which is using the fertilizer", "another tip is to use neem oil check on the back of the neem oil for the amount that you want to mix with the amount of water you have", "but I am creating a little spritzer bottle", "this is natural", "this is a natural way to get rid of those pesky bugs that can get in the way of growing herbs and citrus and so that is why spray a little bit wherever you are starting to see that safe for pets and kids", "so it is kind of like a natural way to get rid of those pests", "so I am spraying to prevent any further pests but", "I am also going to remove those leaves that are not doing so well just pick those off", "so next we are going to talk about seed starting now", "I mentioned that I am a little bit of an impatient gardener and I do prefer to transplant", "but you could start with seeds which is a little bit", "well much less expensive", "so I have these little jiffy strips here", "I have some seed packets that you can get at a nursery Home Depot wherever you you know pretty much want I get organic seeds of the different herbs that I want I have some popsicle sticks so that is why I can label it", "and then you want seed starting soil", "so there is a certain kind of soil you want to ask for when you go there", "so that is why am going to fill up the little pods the little tray with the seed starting soil I am going to go ahead and add that", "and then I am going to add some water so that the soil is nice and damp next", "I am going to take a sharpie and write on the popsicle sticks which herbs I plant", "you know you can do this in your herb garden as is", "but usually you can tell what the herbs are by the smell and the look but when you are planting seeds like this it is really easy to forget where where you have planted what you planted", "so that is why am just going to put those little popsicle sticks", "and I am going to do two pods for each of the seeds now like I mentioned before these seed packets run anywhere from 1 to 250", "so that is why can plant a significant amount of seed starters with this method and save a lot of money", "so really you need two seeds per pod", "so I am going to make a little hole put two seeds in there then cover the hole", "and I am going to do the same", "and then I am going to continue to do this with each type of speed", "so I am going to place this on my windowsill where I know it gets a little bit of Sun", "but not too much", "water it", "and then I do cover it and in four to six weeks you should start to see your little herbs start to sprout", "so another option is to make potted herbs and DIY seed bombs", "this is something I kept seeing kind of everywhere and wanted to try which is basically ripping up a bunch of newspaper putting it into a bowl adding some water sticking it in the food processor getting it nice and kind of mushy", "and then we are going to make little seed bombs so after you put that in a food processor", "I am going to put it over a strainer and push out any extra water", "and then I am going to grab some silicon molds", "and I am going to start filling the silicon molds with this kind of mushy wet newspaper", "so I am going to add a few of the seeds on top", "and then I am going to cover that with some more of the mushy newspaper", "and then I am going to blot out any extra water and then leave these out to dry for about 24 to 48 hours", "and then you will have these seed pods I took a pot", "added some potting soil", "and then I am going to put one of the seed pods on top of the soil", "then put some more soil over the seed pod water it and then continue to water it every day", "keep it so that it is kind of like a wet sponge and keep an eye on it and cross your fingers hopefully in four to six weeks you will have a little plant start to pop up", "so that completes this video", "I really hope you guys enjoyed it if you like these types of videos", "please be sure to thumbs up this video and request more of them in the comments below check out my last two videos", "and I will see you guys again very soon for some future videos"], "UmbxmIA0MUA": ["hey guys welcome back to my channel", "so today is video", "is an herbal DIY video and since I have an abundance of herbs growing in my garden right now", "and I have a lot of dried herbs I figured I would do a video like this and this is actually one of the least expensive videos I have ever made which was kind of nice", "and I enjoyed it", "plus it smelled good and do not worry I do have a garden video coming up very soon where I am going to share with you guys", "kind of how I have been growing my garden and a little garden tour so that is", "what we are doing for today is video so that is why am going to jump right in", "and hopefully you enjoy so the first thing we are going to be making is a custom herbal wellness tea blend", "this is a recipe I got from my friend", "Carly", "and I get my dried herbs at a place called mother nature", "is remedy", "it is a store pretty close to me that sells essential oils dried herbs incense", "they also do acupuncture and they have a dry sauna", "but I go there to buy dried herbs in bulk so that is why have raspberry leaf alfalfa leaf peppermint", "and", "I also have some metal leaf these herbs are believed to boost the immune system now if you are pregnant or breastfeeding be sure to run this by your doctor but many pregnancy and breastfeeding teas actually have these herbs in the tea already", "and you can make a custom blend of tea", "and there is so many different types of custom blend peas that you can make I think I might do a video on that in the future because you can make a nice variety of tea blends when you buy your herbs in bulk", "so I do like to go there to buy bulk dried herbs", "and then you can just do this in some hot water", "you can pour it over ice", "add a little honey if you want to make a little sweeter", "and then you have a custom blend of some delicious wellness tea", "so that was the first herbal DIY that I wanted to share with you guys", "the second one is a DIY herbal wreath which this was actually one of the least expensive reapz I have ever made on my channel and to do that I pruned my garden", "like I normally do the rosemary tends to kind of grow like crazy and pruning", "is actually really important for a healthy garden because it can encourage healthy growth in both flowers and herbs since my rosemary was thriving that is going to be kind of the base of my wreath", "and then I had a good amount of sage which I picked as well", "and then I had some mint and some lavender on the other side of my yard that I went ahead and pruned and put in my basket which if you did not see my boho DIY video", "I share how to make that basket", "but I like that basket for just whenever I prune my herbs", "so that is why have a full basket of herbs and", "I am going to start making my wreath now the way that I am making", "my wreath is I went to Michael", "is", "I got a grapevine wreath on sale for 10", "so this cost 10", "it was between", "actually it might have been eight", "it was between eight and ten dollars", "and then basically I am taking the rosemary which like I said I had the most of so that is going to be my base", "and I am going to kind of stick it inside the grapevine wreath", "and that is going to be the base of my herbal wreath", "now this is you know obviously a little bit more of a rustic wreath", "I like to call it rustic instead of messy because sometimes when you have herbs it just does not look quite as clean as maybe like a fake floral wreath or some of the other wreaths that I have shown on my channel in the past", "but this is really fun plus it smells absolutely amazing", "not when you are working with it", "but when you put it up wherever you decide to put it if you have a smaller one you can put it in the bathroom", "but you could put it on the door and as you can see like I said it is a little bit kind of all over the place", "so I did trim the rosemary so that it looked a little bit cleaner", "and then I took the lavender I started to kind of break it apart and trim it so that I made small little kind of baby bouquets", "and I did this with the lavender and the mint", "I did not have as much mint", "actually I had the least amount of mint", "so that is why just put one or two sprigs of mint on the side of the little lavender", "bouquets that I am making", "and then I am going to put those on top of the rosemary", "and you can do whatever you want with this", "and it depends on what kind of herbs you have or", "which kind you have purchased and want to use for this", "and I am going to take a little bit of this green wire and tie the little bouquets down and then trim the extra wire off", "so I have three lavender and mint bouquets I am going to tuck these in to the inside and over the top of the rosemary", "all the herbs should be going the same direction that definitely looks a little cleaner and better and then just trim it to your liking so it is as clean as you prefer", "and then you have a really nice rustic wreath which I actually think looks pretty for spring and even for Easter", "you can hang it on your door", "this does dry out pretty quick so it does not last super long", "but it definitely smells great", "and I think it looks nice", "so next we are making some herbal incense many of you are probably familiar with smudging with sage there is all sorts of different ways to make incense with herbs", "but I happen to have sage", "so what I am going to be doing here is I am taking these little sage branches I am going to pile them all on top of each other", "so then I am going to roll the sage together and then wrap it with the cotton twine and", "then the key with this is to", "it has plenty of time to dry before you use it as an incense I used to burn incense and sage all the time in our apartment when we lived in our apartment", "and then I got an essential oil diffuser", "and then I became a bigger fan of that because I do think it is a little healthier to diffuse essential oils", "but I do like incense", "and you know I tend to burn incense a little bit more outside funny enough and inside especially now that I am pregnant just because of the smoke", "and if so if we are having dinner outside or everybody is hanging out outside it is warm", "it is nice to burn sage and actually this is an example of a white sage smudge stick which these cost between six to twelve dollars", "so that is why can easily make one yourself another fun one to burn is Palo Santo which has a nice woody almost nostalgic camping smell to it", "so I like to burn it outside", "so you can make a sage stick easy like I just showed you", "and once it dries you can light it and then put it outside", "you put it on a tray and then just let it burn you can use it inside if you want for sure", "but I prefer outside because it is kind of has that like nostalgic hanging out outside camping type of feel", "and then with stage I am also making some herbal all purpose surface cleanser", "I am just using sage leave now if you do not have sage in your garden if you do not have a garden you can certainly buy sage leaves for a buck or two at the grocery store", "and you put the leaves inside a glass bottle", "I get my glass bottles on Amazon", "I order it through Amazon Prime and it comes the next day so that is why am putting I d say five or six or seven leaves at the bottom of the glass bottle", "and then I am going to put half water in half vinegar", "and then you want to just let that kind of sit for a little bit so that the sage can infuse into the water and vinegar", "and then you can use this as a surface spray to clean you know your kitchen counters bathroom counters things like that anything that you would normally use you know vinegar to clean", "this is just like an all purpose surface spray", "there is certain things you ca not use this on but for things like your kitchen counter bathroom counter you can use this on last but", "not least I am touching on herbal infused oils I have talked about this before on my channel in my Valentines Day video because I made a DIY massage oil", "but I wanted to talk about it again in case you missed that video because I do love doing this", "I have a combination of dried herbs here dried lavender and dried chamomile", "I am mixing some of my favorite oils that I actually happened to have so that is why have almond oil", "I have jojoba oil", "and I have avocado oil you can use whatever oil you happen to have whether that is olive oil or coconut oil and", "with chamomile and lavender you are getting a very calming oil you can also use", "I had", "some green tea sand dried green tea so that is why made one with green tea as well which is more uplifting you can use that it has a little bit of caffeine", "so if you have cellulite or concerns of that kind", "so this is actually the dried green tea that I am going to infuse with the same oils that I have so", "whatever dried herbs you have you can make a infused oil and the key here is to let this soak in the dried herbs for anywhere from two to two days to a week really I usually put a little cheese cloth on top", "and I use that to strain so that I do not get any of the actual dried herb in the oil once it is had a chance to infuse into the oil", "then I will pour it into a glass dropper again", "I get my glass items like my glass droppers on Amazon", "I usually buy them like four or five at a time so it is a little cheaper", "and then I am going to pour that into there", "and you can use that again on your body you can use it for your cuticles", "wherever you would not you know on the ends of your hair you can kind of use it", "however you want smells really nice and depending on what types of dried herbs you use it has multiple benefits", "hopefully you guys enjoyed this video if you did please be sure to give it a big thumbs up and subscribe to my channel for new videos every single week", "and I will see you guys in the next video very soon bye"], "Cnr7o8c9-cc":

what you have already seen", "so that is why want to be careful not to be too redundant", "but I will probably do another one of those maybe like what is in my hospital bag and a few other pregnancy

report on", "I will show a little belly shot", "but I figured today for this particular video", "I might show you guys a few things I got for the baby", "I have it", "you know to be honest", "I am having another boy", "and I have so many boys clothes I have a lot of stuff that I do not need to get a bunch of new stuff i did get a double stroller", "and i have the Peg Perego booklet stroller that we loved for traveling we", "you know if we have actually taken Oliver to quite a few places we took him to Japan and we have taken him to Seattle and Alaska and all over the country we have taken him to Texas and Orlando", "and he is kind of been a little traveler with us and", "the booklet was great because it would close really fast and when you are in an airport and you need to be you know you need to close up the stroller and put it to the side to get on the airplane quick", "it was one of those strollers that was easy to open and close", "and I actually had the Britax when he was first born which is great", "and then I still have the britax marathon car seat", "so anyway I got the Peg Perego booklet double stroller", "I love that brand", "I actually have the seating one pregnancy brain cannot remember what it is called the speeding table um high chair", "I have a high chair from Peg Perego which I love and definitely a little bit pricey", "but I knew I was going to use it for however many kids wind up having which we are pretty sure we are done after two", "but you never know", "so that is why am going to keep it around", "and I love it", "it is still in like mint condition", "I love the stroller so that is why got that", "and then I got a new car seat because our other car seat was kind of like a little", "we have the marathon for Oliver and the first car seat we had when he was very first born", "is a little beat up", "so everything else has been kind of you know like little doodads here", "and there I got some more a swaddles actually found these at t j maxx for 12 99", "these are the bamboo ones which the band is old ones", "are a lot softer", "but I wanted to try these out because as the bamboo were so soft that when I would swaddle him he would just break free they are not as soft as the bamboo", "but I am hoping they will work better for swaddling so that is why got these you can find these on sales at t j maxx in various places", "12 99 was pretty good for two I felt", "I also got at t j maxx with nubby baby LED feeding suction plate", "I am going to open this guy up and just to show you", "can I get him", "this was 7 99 at t j maxx which you know is for when the baby is a little bit older", "so this is 7 99 which I thought was a great deal microwave and dishwasher safe bpa free", "so that is why put this down", "it is suctions", "and then you can put the food on there", "this next thing is a tiny bit scary but I did want to try it because I feel like it is heavy", "but I am going to be holding the bottle for what I am going to be breastfeeding as long as possible", "but I wanted to get glass bottles", "so that is why got these Advent Advent Advent", "oh events for newborn", "you can see they look like this so that is why did not bring bottles with me to the hospital when I had all of her bottles and formula and", "that was one thing I regretted", "and I wanted to do this time because they do not really provide bottle of formula", "but my milk did not come in", "and I wish I had something to give him a bottle because he got jaundice and from my perspective I feel like if I would have given him a bottle sooner", "it may have helped prevent jaundice", "I want to at least have that as an option so that is why am going to have some formula and some bottles with me in case my milk does not come in

formula at that point", "we had taken him to there was like a Children is Hospital where they put them in the beds for jaundice and everything", "and they already started feeding in whatever formula they had so", "that is why ended up having my mom go and get the formula that I wanted and that I preferred and so this time I want to be a little bit more prepared because I I was not at that point", "I had everything else except for that", "so that is why am bringing that with me to the hospital", "and then I got like one little pair of baby pants", "I have", "so many pairs of baby clothes from Oliver at all different sizes but one of my friends gave me a great tip to shop the cotton on sale section for kids clothes", "so these were five bucks", "how cute are these I have not seen a pair of tiny pants like this", "oh my gosh", "so cute", "so cotton on has the greatest deals for kids clothes if you shop there clearance section so that is why did get a new diaper bag", "this is a Nana and

going to be doing a giveaway of one of their bags on my Instagram", "so if you do not follow me on instagram will follow me there I am going to be hosting one in the next month or so", "but I saw this particular style on Pinterest", "and I was looking everywhere for it", "I ended up looking on ebay just randomly", "and this was the this and one other Nanak", "oh bag showed up and it was the exact style that I wanted so", "that is why ended up getting it", "I got it at a fraction of the cost which is super cool and", "this is what I am going to use as my diaper bag", "it has these like little side pockets for bottles here", "these are the most beautiful bag they are handmade they are super unique they are made with dresses that are recycled and every bag is unique and totally beautiful and awesome", "and I still have my black diaper guy that I had with Oliver I am going to keep that around", "I mean it is still in pretty good condition", "so in case I need it for whatever reason", "but I wanted kind of like a purse that doubles as a diaper bag", "so this is the one that I got so inside", "I have the covered good little breastfeeding cover it also can go over the car seat I got this in gray in white", "I love this cover goods kind of breastfeeding cover", "I got the Aden anime dream blanket which", "I also had for Oliver he still uses to this day", "and he loves it", "okay", "I

good", "I feel great", "and I you know got a few little things here", "and there for the baby and I am probably going to get too much more I am not having a baby shower because there is not really

to", "we", "you know we got but", "besides that everything else", "oh", "and I got my little diaper bag but besides that we kind of have everything we need", "so that is why are really excited", "we are getting closer and I will show you guys a little bump date I am wearing this dress from Carly Jean Los Angeles", "she is my friend", "and I have been wearing a lot of kind of like pregnancy dresses I ca not work honestly", "I am at that phase where I wear the same three or four things for the rest of the pregnancy", "so I am not much of a fashionista", "maybe I will do like a hall or a collective hall or something once I am done having the baby", "and I get a few new things", "but all right so that completes this video thanks so much for watching you guys", "and I will see you very soon bye"], "GX3JawtRqHM": ["hey guys welcome back to my channel", "so today is video is going to be fun", "I have been compiling a few different boho inspired DIYs that I wanted to share on my channel in today", "is video is going to be that", "so that is why am going to jump right in", "and hopefully you guys enjoy these really fun", "DIYs", "okay", "so let is start with the first one which is a boho hanging jar you can use this for candles", "but I prefer it for flowers and all you need is some twine in a mason jar", "I get my twine at the dollar store it usually comes with about two or three for a dollar", "and then I am going to take six strands of twine", "and I am going to have it be", "six feet long", "so six six foot long strands of twine", "then I am going to have the mason jar", "so that is why am going to fold that in half", "and then I am going to take that and make a loop at the top", "so that is why am going to have a large knot and a loop", "then I am going to go ahead and put that down", "and I am going to take the strands", "and I am going to partner them two by two", "so that is why am going to take two here again again", "and then you will have six sets of two once you have six sets of two coupled twine pieces I am going to take those two and knot them about one inch down from the large original", "not so as you can see here", "I am making a knot", "and then I am going to do that with all six pairs of two", "so at this point you should have knotted all six pairs of two then after you have done that you are going to want to take the two closest sections of twine underneath the knots that you just finished", "and not those together", "so it might start to get a little confusing at this point", "but hopefully when you see what I am doing it will make sense so that is why am taking the two closest pieces of twine underneath the knots", "and I am going to create another knot", "and it is going to start creating a little bit of a net", "and you are going to do this all the way around until it creates a net so it might start to seem a little confusing at this point", "so basically you have those two knots that I am taking the two pieces of twine that are closest together going down an inch and then creating a knot", "and again you just continue to do this all the way around", "I have seen a bunch of these all over the internet and people do them different", "but I will show you where I got this from where I learned how to do it and that will hopefully give you some further instructions but again as you can see the two knots taking the two pieces of twine going down an inch creating a knot and doing this all the way around", "and now I am getting to the end", "and I am going to have to connect the end piece all the way to the right with the end piece all the way to the left to create a net", "and then once you have done this then you can put the mason jar inside", "and it will be able to hold the mason jar", "so that is why was a little worried about this one because it was confusing enough as it was to try to figure it out", "I was a little worried because using on the Internet so hopefully between what I put in the description in this video you can then figure out how to do this because it is pretty cool", "and I think it looks pretty neat", "I am just taking a piece of twine and wrapping it around the top to secure the net a little bit more and I am going to create a little knot then for the hanging pieces I am going to go up about two or three inches and create a nether knot", "so one large knot here enough room to be able to get flowers or a candle in", "and then I am going to section that off into two sections and then braid what I have so braid the two sections", "so I am just going and doing a simple three part braid", "and then I am going to do that on the other side as well", "and then do one final knot", "and then I promise I am finished", "and then you can fill this up with some flowers or a candle", "be careful with the candle obviously and twine", "but if you have it at the bottom of the mason jar it should be fine you you next", "I am making a unique boho yoga mat which you can do a variety of different ways", "so that is why want to start with a yoga mat I got one for eight nine dollars on a website", "I will try to link the website but you can get them on eBay for pretty cheap", "too definitely look to get a discounted yoga mat", "and then you want to find some discounted tapestry you can definitely overspend on tapestry", "but I tend to find tapestry on eBay or stores that sell it in bulk for between five to eight dollars so that is why placed the tapestry on top of the yoga mat in the position that I desired and then just cut kind of roughly around it", "and I folded it underneath the yoga mat", "took some clothes pins and pinned one side", "and then I am going to pull back the other side", "and I am going to start with some tacky glue or", "some Elmer is glue", "I actually did a combination of two because it does take quite a bit of glue", "and I was running out of chalky glue so that is why put a little bit down", "and then I took a brush and made sure to evenly spread it all over the mat and this took a while", "but you want to you have glue all over the mat so that it is", "you know it is well secured when you finally decide to put the tapestry back on top and glue it so that is why would highly recommend getting a partner or somebody to help you with this next part because you want to have someone on either side", "and you want to gently put the tapestry down onto the glue", "take your hand and rub any air bubbles out and then be careful because if you rub too hard the glue will start coming out through the tapestry so that is why want to be pretty gentle but take your hand and get any air bubbles out and make it as flat and clean as possible", "and then I am going to let that dry overnight", "and then I am going to come the next day", "flip it over", "I am going to cut it evenly so it is about one and a half inch on the back side of the mat I am going to add some glue", "and I am going to glue that down as well", "and then I am going to let that dry for about six to eight hours", "the great thing about this particular mat is you can customize it to whatever colors you prefer whatever style you like", "and I think it is fun and unique", "and you can have a very individual and unique looking yoga mat or Pilates mat when you go to class or if you do it at home", "so that is why love that next we are doing a rope basket which I think it was between the mat and this", "but I think this one was my favorite", "so that is why am taking a basket I am going to kind of try to make this similar to for a reference", "and then I got this rope on sale", "so it was ten dollars", "I got a coupon and got it at jo ann fabric you can take some parchment paper and put it over the bucket so that you do not accidentally glue the bucket", "and then I am going to start creating a circle and going around and round", "so that is why am taking a little bit of glue", "I am gluing it", "and then I am going to start making a spiral and", "this is going to be the bottom of the basket so this is not so much hard as it is time consuming", "so you might want to put on the show", "if you plan to do this it did kind of take a while a little bit longer than what I expected", "but again I am gluing spiraling gluing spiraling", "it is basically like a cinnamon roll", "you are just going round and round and round adding a little bit of glue", "and you are going to keep doing this until you create the entire bottom", "and then you are just going to keep creating the entire basket so once you create the bottom then you are going to keep doing it", "but you are going to go down on the side of the bucket", "so it is good to have a bucket for reference", "otherwise it is going to end up being kind of like a flat row almost carpet which that would be fun too", "you can make that if you wanted to but for this we are making a basket and this is going to be either a fruit basket or a foraging basket", "so if you want something you know to go into your garden and grab a bunch of goodies from your garden you can use this basket for that", "but as you can see here I am continuing to glue and go round and round and round until I finish the basket then when you are all finished", "you have this beautiful basket so it is a little time consuming", "but I think it is so beautiful", "and you can either do a fruit basket you could certainly add handles if you want that is an option", "but I did not feel that it needed it", "and so you can add fruit in there if you want I love it as a little foraging basket", "you can take it out to your garden", "I have a lot of flowers that I like to pick and so that is why went and check it out there and picked a bunch of fresh flowers", "and then I went over to a different area of my yard and pick some smaller flowers", "and then I went over to the garden", "and I grabbed some fresh sage and rosemary and", "did you know filled up the basket with a bunch of goodies from the garden so that is why love this", "this was actually my favorite", "like I said", "I mean they were all fun to make", "but I loved how this turned out", "and it is a soft like great feeling basket", "so right now I am picking rosemary our rosemary is doing really well right now", "so that is why have a ton of it", "and I was so happy the whole basket just smelled amazing and looked so pretty", "and I was", "I was so happy that I made it", "so definitely", "my favorite DIY", "so I have two leftover scraps from the tapestry so that is why am going to make a headband and some cute sandals so starting with the headband I am going to take a really long piece or two long pieces of tapestry", "and I am going to fold them in half", "so that is why actually folded them in half just so that you do not get the bottom side of the tapestry", "you get the really pretty vibrant top of the tapestry", "and then I am folding it in half one more time", "and then I am going to take that and loop them together like this", "so that is why am going to put one piece through the other piece", "and you can put it on your head", "one of two ways you can either tie it at the top into like a little knot or a little bow and", "that is fun just kind of like for around the house or if you you know want to be chill", "like you would with a scarf or the other side looks more like a headband and so you can make a custom headband with your tapestry scraps", "so that is what I did with that", "and then for the other parts of the scraps that I did not use I am going to be making some fun custom sandals so for the colorful sandals you just want to start with a pair of sandals", "I just have a plain pair of Havaianas that I wear all the time you want a tapestry scrap that is about two to three feet long", "and then I am going to go ahead", "put that where your toe goes", "and then I am going to go ahead and start wrapping around the sandal strap", "and so basically you are just creating a custom sandal strap", "and I am going to wrap each side and there is a few options with the leftover at the end", "you can either tie it around your leg or you can cut it make a little knot", "and then you basically the sandal straps are decorated with the tapestry so that is why have a few different options", "my personal favorite was the sandal straps by themselves and instead of wrapping it around your leg", "I did not have enough tapestry to go all the way at my leg and might look too cute", "or if I did but just wrap it around the sandal strap and you can crisscross it going behind your leg or in front of your leg", "there is a few different ways that you can do it and depending on how long it is", "like I said you can do a few different Criss crosses on your legs and that would they really look cute in the summer with a pair of shorts or whatever", "so that is why have a few different options with these", "I ended up cutting the extra and tucking it into the little knot that I had made at the bottom of the strap", "and then I just had these sandals with decorated strap", "and I liked that", "but again if you have a longer piece of tapestry go ahead and wrap it around your leg", "and I think that would be cute in the summer for a boho look as well", "so these are really fun", "excuse my toes", "I do not have the best toes", "and I had a little bit of the carpet", "I had like a carpet marks on my feet", "but anyway hopefully you guys enjoyed this video", "and you found one of these to be interesting", "you might try it out if you do

have been loving around here", "and I wanted to share with you guys these are great for kids", "but even if you do not have kids hopefully you will find one of these that you enjoy and try because they are all yummy at least in my opinion", "so that is what I am going to be sharing with you guys today", "so let is jump right in", "I am going to start with a homemade salsa which is easy to make I have two large tomatoes that I got at the farmers market", "so that is why are fresh and ready to go", "and I wanted to make something with them so that is why decided to make some fresh salsa", "I also have some cilantro from my garden I have about 1 4 of a large white onion", "and then I have 1 4 of a jalapeno that I took all the seeds out of my son likes a little bit of spice if your child is not like spice at all", "you could totally omit it", "but it is not very spicy at all I would say it is mild", "and then I am adding about 2 pinches of salt", "I added the juice of a half of a lemon and then the juice of two limes limes do not yield as much juice as lemon so that is why did add lemon", "but you could do limes if you want", "and I am putting the top of my blender on", "I have the Magic Bullet here and", "the key here is to pulse because if you let it go it is going to turn into like tomato juice so that is why want to pulse it", "and then if you need to you can strain it", "but I poured it in a bowl", "and I had fresh salsa", "so at first the salsa is a little bit pale looking", "but it starts to get redder and redder", "and I paired it with these bean chips which have some protein and some fiber", "they are a little bit healthier than traditional chips and they are good too and they pair great with guacamole or a homemade fresh salsa", "so if you have those ingredients sitting around in your fridge make some homemade salsa", "it is a really yummy snack next", "is a super easy veggie platter which I mentioned before my blog", "this is something that I will do as a snack or even sometimes as a lunch for my son so that is why cut up some cucumbers celery avocado", "you can add cheese or sliced roasted turkey if you want to you know", "the more you add it becomes more of like a meal type thing instead of a snack", "but I will put this out", "I will put a little bit of Himalayan pink salt on the cucumber and avocado", "and then I will set it out for all of us to enjoy", "I usually share it with him so that is easy the next thing is sweet potato toast I am preheating my oven to 350 degrees", "and then I cut three toasts sized strips of a sweet potato", "put those on a baking sheet you can see they are pretty thin here", "and then I am going to put those in the oven at 350 degrees for about 20 to 25 minutes or until they are completely cooked you can keep an eye on them they will start to brown a little bit then when they are done you can pull it out you can add a little bit of butter on it if you want or in this case I put avocado directly on top a little bit of pink salt", "I have seen it with peanut butter and banana", "this is kind of becoming", "more popular it is so delicious", "my son really loves it", "I love it", "and I have been kind of obsessing on sweet potatoes", "right now we have been getting them in our box", "so we have had them", "but", "I also love them", "I would say if you add something else with it it could be a meal", "but it is also a really great snack as well next", "we are making kale chips which are so delicious", "and I got to say if you like dried seaweed or your kids like dried seaweed", "you will probably like this", "it is very easy to make them just taking kale chopping it up", "I am going to put it on a baking sheet", "and I am going to add some extra virgin olive oil on top and a little bit of sea salt", "and then you stick it in the oven at 350 degrees", "keep an eye on it", "but it takes about 10 minutes for them to dehydrate and crisp up", "and then they turn into these great chips", "but I would say it kind of reminds me of the seaweed the dried seaweed", "but I actually like this a little bit better than that", "and my son likes it", "and my husband likes it too", "so it might sound gross at first but", "it is actually they are really good", "they may not be for everyone", "but we definitely enjoy them around here", "and they are easy quick to make and pretty affordable and as you can see when you take them out they are dehydrated and crunchy", "I put them into a bowl and set them out for everybody to enjoy and a little bit healthier than potato chips they do not taste like potato chips", "but they taste good", "and like I said if you like the dried seaweed it is like that but a little bit less", "see tasting if that makes sense I actually enjoy this better", "so next we are going to be moving into treats and we are going to be making some homemade popsicles starting with a coconut popsicle chai popsicle and a mango popsicles so as the weather starts to get a little warmer", "I know it is cold in certain places still", "but as it gets warmer in the spring and summer", "these are nice treats for you or your children so that is why have one cup of coconut milk a tablespoon of maple syrup and a little bit of vanilla bean", "it is optional to add shredded coconut some people like that texture some people do not", "but I ended up adding the shredded coconut", "so the mixture is a little bit thicker looking as I pour it in", "but I am just going to pour it into two molds and then put the tops on I", "like these molds you can find them for", "I think gosh under 8 or something at", "Target Bed Bath Beyond also has it and we use them all the time when the weather starts to get warm I will give him a popsicle while he is playing outside", "and you can monitor a little bit better you know how much sugar goes in there you can make smoothies juices and turn them into popsicles", "the other one is the chai so that is why am taking the Tazo chai classic latte and almond milk and", "this is actually the combo I use when i make a chai latte", "so that is why am starting with a cup of the chai concentrate and then a cup of almond milk and", "I am actually going to have some extra over to make a chai latte", "but I am going to add a little bit of vanilla bean a tiny bit", "and then I am going to put that in one of the mold", "this does have a little bit of caffeine but not very much at all it actually says on the container how much it has", "and it also says you know how much sugar and everything else that is in there too", "so I have been enjoying those they are very delicious", "so that is why made one of those I ended up actually being the one to eat this I gave Oliver a bite or two", "but this one ended that thing for me so if you like chai you might like a chai popsicle and then the rest I am just putting over ice as a chai latte so if you enjoyed chai latte this is the easiest tri latte recipe you could ever imagine so much cheaper than getting it at Starbucks and super delicious you can also make it with coconut milk which I like too now for the mango one we are basically making a smoothie so that is why have the frozen mango", "and I am going to add some coconut milk", "and you can add some sweetener if you want like maple syrup or agave", "I added a little bit of lemon juice half of a lemon and that is it", "and actually my son enjoyed it", "I did not even have to add any sweetener to it", "so if your kids do not mind and they will eat it like this", "and I think it is a treat", "then you do not even have to add anything at all", "but if it is not sweet enough you can add maple syrup or agave or whatever sweetener you prefer", "so that is why blend", "that up then I pour that into the mold", "and then I am going to freeze those overnight", "and then you have a bunch of yummy popsicles ready to go once they are completely frozen", "take out whichever one you want and then run it under warm water to release it from the popsicle container and you need to do that for a few seconds", "and then it will be ready to go and in this case Oliver wanted a mango one", "so that is the one I gave him last but", "not least I am going to share with you guys a smoothie I make for my son Oliver", "this is the peanut butter chocolate greens smoothie I use the kids super food outrageous chocolate powder which is basically like a smoothie powder you can add it with milk if you want or in this case I am adding almond milk", "but I have iced almond milk a scoop of the powder I am going to add a spoonful of peanut butter and", "then some frozen banana and this combination together is so delicious I usually end up stealing a little bit from him because it tastes so good", "and it is a good way to sneak in greens to your kids diet because it tastes good", "and it is full the powder is full of healthy greens for kids", "I also have the berry version of this too which you can mix with water and make a popsicle if you want or you can make a juice", "but it is a good way to sneak in those greens to your kids diet", "so it is muhaha they do not know what you are doing tastes good", "and I always tell him it is a treat", "so sometimes I will make it for him in the morning", "I usually try not to give more than one juice or smoothie every day but he loves it and you will drink it so quick I made an adult version of this in my self care video", "but you could add a chocolate protein or greens powder into one if you want to make the adult version of one", "but this is super good", "hopefully you guys found one recipes to be interesting you will try it out", "and you will like it for your family", "if you like my videos please be sure to subscribe to my channel",

products into my routine so as not to be too redundant today", "I am pairing a few old favorites plus a bunch of new recent ones that I am loving for spring I try to do this once a week because my normal routine is not super extensive usually on the weekends I do this", "so hopefully you guys enjoy and I am going to jump right in as per usual for me", "a pamper routine starts with a shower I spray some clearing eucalyptus spray inside the shower I have done a DIY version of this too", "but I just got this at Target then while the shower warms up I dry brush talked about dry brushing a bunch on my channel", "but I have gotten a lot better about doing it before every single shower especially now that I am pregnant", "it gets the blood flowing", "and I brush pretty rigorously going up towards my heart", "I do it on my belly on my legs on my arms", "and then I have been using the caviar alterna shampoo and conditioner I have gone in and out of using it", "but I have repurchased it a total of three times this is the best shampoo and conditioner in my opinion as far as the results and how it makes your hair look and feel it is also good for color treated hair so if your hair is color treated it is a great one", "then I am going to be using the honey and sage hair conditioner I got this from Target", "I like the ingredients this was actually developed by a fellow youtuber which I love as well", "and so I just put this to the ends of my hair mid to end I will do a hair mask once a week usually no more than that so while that is in my hair", "I am just using my lavender castile soap", "I made this combo", "it is aloe vera vitamin E and castle soap", "so it is softening to the skin I showed that in a recent video so you could check that out so that is why use the mother special blends oil on my stomach", "and I rub that in really nicely around my stomach to prevent stretch marks", "and then I have been using the dream cream all over my body", "I finished up the DIY belly butter I made and", "so that is why picked up a new one of these I have used this in the past", "but I just put this all over my body and it is really rich and luxurious then for my face I am moving to dark angels", "this is like a scrub cleanser combination", "it is charcoal so that is why take a little bit", "you add water", "and then you use it as a scrub or a mask", "so right now I am going to use it", "as like I said a scrub mask", "I really like this because my skin has an interesting texture the texture changes a little bit when I am pregnant", "I do experience breakouts and so that is why really like to use a good exfoliant like this one", "this one is grainy", "and I really feel a difference in the texture of my skin when I am done using it", "so that is why am going to use that", "and then I am going to allow it to sit on my skin and kind of clean out my pores for about 15 to 20 minutes once it is dried", "I am going to wash it off with some work one thing I love to do when I do a pamper routine", "is to layer masks so I just did the charcoal one", "now I am doing the hot vegan probiotic mask by Pacifica", "I love this brand", "this smells amazing", "it smells like coconut", "and I felt the difference and saw a difference in my skin", "I keep this on for 10 to 15 minutes", "I absolutely love it", "I highly recommend it next", "I am using the dirty toothy tabs which these are new to my routine", "I got these", "I do not use these every single day I use a traditional toothpaste because I do my dentist recommends that I do", "but I use this one

smell good", "I like it", "they are cool", "and then I have been using this", "is a part of my routine castor oil I have been taking a tiny bit of castor oil on the tips of my finger putting it on my

the day I will blow", "dry my hair", "if I know I am staying home which in this case I was going to stay home for the rest of the day I partially blow dried my hair", "put it up in a ponytail but the way that I blow dry", "my hair is I look like cousin it", "I put all my hair in front of my face", "and I blow dry it like this until it is either completely dry or if I am not really going out", "and

Target", "I actually did not get anything outside of the dollar in three dollar section", "I found these really great ceramic containers", "then I am going to put succulents inside it", "has climbs so you can either hang it up or put it on a table", "and then", "I also got some fake succulents which I found this at the dollar store as well", "and we spruced it up in my DIY video", "but these come in really nice containers in the dollar and three dollar section at Target", "so you can grab those there too", "I also got these great kind of like message in a bottle vases from Target for three dollars apiece as well", "so I did not even go into the decor section which can be a little bit more expensive at Target", "but if you hit up the dollar three dollar section you can find some great treasures so home goods always has something different", "and I found this great spring wreath now", "I know I made one in a dollar store video but", "by time I compiled all the elements from the dollar store it was about twenty three dollars", "so this one was under 30 so that is why could buy one I also liked this wicker tray", "this is from a brand called boho Living which it liked a bunch of their things at HomeGoods and then home goods is a really great place to get fake plants I like to do a combo of fake and real plants real plants", "are obviously high maintenance and fake plants", "can look just as good and last for a really really long time", "so that is why had this lavender and kind of the grassy look", "and then I got this solar lantern", "I actually have two very similar ones that I got two years ago at Target and basically it charges in the Sun in the day", "and then it lights up at night", "so it is great for outside especially during the summer", "so okay", "so now I am going to show you guys how I decorated with these items so that is why took the DIY wreath that I made in a previous video", "and I replaced it with the one that I got at HomeGoods", "and I love that color it is vibrant perfect for spring for the lavender", "I tried a few different places I tried the bathtub the master bath and also the guest bath", "I ended up starting with it in the guest bathroom", "and then I got some fresh flowers at the store and moved it to the main bathroom", "and I kind of move it around wherever it fits", "but it lasts forever and looks great and that is the great thing about the fake lavender I have definitely found some bigger items at HomeGoods", "but more often than not I found these kind of smaller things that work great in the house for decorating also throw pillows can be pricey", "surprisingly they are expensive so you can find good price points at home goods", "I got a turquoise one and more of kind of like a beachy looking one", "and I like to definitely add color because I have a lot of neutrals in my house", "and then I just put the tray and the fake grass on the coffee table for something really simple which that will probably be moved because my son likes to play cards on the coffee table", "but it looks really pretty and clean for now", "so that is why am happy about", "that now I want to show you guys how I made an indoor tablescape I love to dress up the table especially if we are having guests over but", "even if we are just having dinner as a family this one is really dressed up", "so what I did with this was there is a little hiking spot on the way to the park which the park is just a few blocks away from where we live", "so there is this open hiking spot that has huge rosemary bushes", "so I picked some rosemary great branches lavender", "I mean there is tons", "and so I took my scissors", "and I got as much as I could I decided to forage", "and it is", "nobody is land or property or anything it belongs to the city so you can kind of go for it", "and there is tons and tons of bushes", "so that is why just decided to go for it", "and I actually got this idea from a friend of mine", "we had a bunch of people over for dinner several nights back", "and she brought a bunch of herbs and branches", "and she set it all out on the table so when he put out the dinner it was so pretty", "so that is why went", "did that", "and then I had this great container", "I got it home good", "probably about 2 or 3 years ago if you live somewhere where you can easily access Moss by all means go and get some moss but it is kind of hard to get around here", "so that is why did have to buy moss", "and I basically measured the top of the container for how much I would need", "and I created a circle", "and then I took them off out", "I have some potting soil in there", "and then I am putting the moss directly on there to create a really easy Moss", "centerpiece so that is going to go in the very very center of the table", "and then I am going to take the message in a bottle three dollar bottles that I got from Target", "I am going to fill them up with water", "and then I am going to put the foraged herbs in there and so instead of having to go to the store and get flowers you can walk around your neighborhood and see what you can find and create a great little centerpiece with that", "so this is pretty tall you can have it out for like an Easter or spring dinner", "and you can move it if you want to so that you can see your guests or you can keep it there whatever you prefer", "so I took some of the flowers the rosemary the lavender", "and I put that in those 3 vases", "and then I just put the rest all over the table like I learned from sweet girl her name was Bonnie when she came over and did that", "and I loved the idea", "and I am going to do it forever more", "and it dresses up the table and makes it look lovely in my opinion", "and you can go as much or as little as you want whatever you could pick um", "but I thought it was really pretty", "and I I want to do it a lot more in the future", "so I did that indoor and then", "I also I am going to go ahead and do an outdoor table scape as well because if you have good weather coming in the spring and the summer months you know you might want to take dinner outside starting with the outdoor tablescape", "I got some succulents from a great little vendor at the farmers market he is a wonderful man who sells it for about 250 to 3 apiece for these kind of bigger ones", "and then he gives the instructions on how to take care of them which I love", "but you can also find these I have ordered them on Amazon before", "and I took the ceramic containers filled it with the succulent soil", "and then I took the succulents out of the containers that they were in and put them in these great 3 00 containers that I got from Target", "so that is why want to make a little hole in the soil put the succulents in the hole and then put some soil around the edges so that it comes to the top of the container so you can either hang it which there was a great spot in my house that I normally hang lanterns with candles inside", "but I decided to hang those up there", "but the other option is to just set it down on a table", "it looks really pretty to hang it", "but you can also set it down", "so that is why actually took it outside and decided to put it on the outdoor table scape and that looked as pretty", "and so um I did that", "and", "I also did the same thing that I did on the inside of the house for the indoor table scape I took whatever I had leftover and put it down on the table I mentioned those lanterns before I got those two years ago at Target", "and they are solar powered", "and they have lasted so that is why have some Palo Santo there which is", "it is like an incense I have not been burning incense in the house", "but because I am pregnant but I will do it outside if we are having guests or whatever over and it smells really woodsy and nice", "and then I just took the fake succulents that I got from Target put that out", "and then the homemade mason jar candles that I have made on my channel", "I have a few DIY videos where I have made those and that was the outdoor table", "scape again pretty affordable", "and I think it looks really great if you are going to be having dinner outside with guests and when it got dark I lit the candles and I put the other solar powered lantern that I got from home goods next to my outdoor furniture", "I hope you guys enjoyed this

juices that I do on the daily", "and I have done a video like this before in the past", "but I have kind of changed up my smoothies and juices so these ones are a little bit different than the ones I have shared before", "so that is why am going to share these recipes with you guys for a quick video", "I will have another video up this week hopefully", "so this wo not be the one in case you are not interested in juices", "but we are going to start with the coconut hemp smoothie which is good I am starting with some cranberries I kind of eyeball", "it", "so I d say this is about 1 4 of a cup", "then I am going to add about a cup of blueberries you can add more or less depending on what your preferences are so if you like more the cranberries it will be a little bit more tart", "but I am adding some blueberries and then coconut milk or almond milk", "whatever you have I am going to fill enough milk to cover the frozen blueberries and cranberries", "and then I am going to add some shredded coconut and some hemp seeds hemp seeds", "are extremely nutritious", "they have omega fatty acid", "they are similar to like chia seeds and flax seeds", "but there are so many benefits you can look up all the benefits on Google if you are curious", "but they are amazing for you", "and it is a great way to kind of pump up a smoothie", "and you ca not taste it when it is in a smoothie", "so that is why are not the best tasting", "but if you put it in a salad or a smoothie you ca not taste it at all", "so this one is because of the shredded coconut it is a little bit more of a less smooth smoothie", "but I did not mind it", "I really liked the coconut flakes", "but if you do not like that you can have the coconut milk and omit the coconut flakes", "but I like", "that one next is a Beauty boosting smoothie because everything that we are using is rich in antioxidants great for your skin", "so I have 1 2 of a cup of blueberries 1 2 of a cup of frozen bananas and 1 4 of a cup of some frozen raspberries", "I forgot what those were called for a second and", "then coconut milk covering these frozen berries and again more or less of whatever you like I have had to spite a mix for 10 years I got for my wedding as a wedding gift", "and it has never led me wrong so that is why love this movie", "you can drink this movie all by itself or you can add the smoothie with another smoothie and make a parfait which is what I am going to make next", "so next I am making", "a coconut Chia smoothie parfait now I have shown coconut Chia on my channel before but on my Instagram story I had a bunch of you message me and asked me how to make it", "so I am going to briefly go over it real quick", "so two cups of coconut milk to 1 4 of a cup of chia", "and then you are just going to mix that up now", "you can either add sweetener like a little bit of maple syrup or palm sugar whatever you prefer or you do not have to add any sweetener at all", "but you are just going to mix this up", "really nicely cover it and then stick it in the refrigerator overnight", "it is going to turn into a pudding now", "I am making the beauty Boost smoothie", "and I am going to put this on top of the parfait so the coconut chia is going to go first", "and then the beauty boosting smoothie is going to go second", "then I am going to make a green smoothie to go on top", "it is going to be a coconut Chia layered smoothie parfait for the top layer of the smoothie", "I am adding two Kiwis a handful of spinach", "some banana", "a few frozen bananas either coconut milk or almond milk whatever you prefer", "and I am going to blend that up really good and that is going to be the top layer of the parfait so that is why am going to begin layering starting by scooping in the coconut chia pudding", "you can do as little or as much as you want", "I happen to love it", "so that is why put a lot in there", "then the Beauty boosting smoothie is going in next trying to get it as even as possible", "but I failed slightly and then the top of the smoothie is going to be the green spinach", "Kiwi smoothie", "and then you can top it with some berries some shades coconut whatever you want", "but this absolutely delicious", "I loved this so that is the way that you can kind of layer different smoothies", "alright", "so next I am going to be sharing some fresh juices", "so one juice that I am really liking right now is two celery sticks one apple half of a lemon half of the cucumber one ginger thumb and a handful of kale", "so this is kind of like the green smoothie I am going for", "right now I have done a few different green smoothies on my channel before but this is the combination that I am liking right now", "and I change it up all the time another one of my favorites is the spicy carrot juice", "this is five carrots one apple half of a lemon and one sum of ginger", "the ginger is kind of what makes it spicy", "but it is almost like a carrot lemonade", "oh it is so good", "this is probably my favorite one it is sweet", "its tart", "it is spicy", "it is everything that is so good", "and if I have carrots I definitely like to make that", "and then for the final green juice this one is I", "it is not as pretty looking because you are mixing a few different color so ends up looking kind of brown", "but I am using one cup of pineapple half of the cucumber carrots celery sticks 1 cup of spinach and 1 cup of cabbage", "it is just a good green juice", "but it kind of comes out looking more Brown than green", "but it still tastes good", "I really like this one as well", "so those combinations are kind of the combinations that I have been really liking and again I switch up my juices and my smoothies all the time depending on what I have in the refrigerator to be honest and also I d like to try out a variation of different ones", "but these are the ones that I have been liking right now", "so hopefully you guys find one that you liked and

effective and we are focusing on two different ingredients as the base of these DIY beauties so that is why have aloe vera and coconut oil", "and we are going to be making a bunch of different things with those two ingredients", "so let is start first with DIY beauty using aloe vera we are going to be making a super easy aloe vera body wash so that is why am basically upgrading a body wash that I already used because I use castile soap in my shower", "right now this is the lavender castile soap I get at Whole Foods", "I love it", "I get it in the economy size and put them in little jars on my shower if you watched", "my turn your bathroom into a spa video", "I talked a little bit about that", "so we are upgrading this shower gel", "I am adding 1 4 of a cup of aloe vera to a half of a cup of the castile soap", "and then I am going to be adding some vitamin E 1tsp of vitamin E and mixing that together", "and then you can pour that into a large container or a small container in this case", "I have this little container so that is why am putting it into a travel sized container so that is why am going to use a funnel", "you can make a big batch or a smaller batch", "but again this just kind of upgrades a body wash", "and it did really suds up nice", "but it was also very moisturizing to the skin", "this is great for the summer months as well if you get a sunburn or anything like that", "but aloe vera in general is just great for the skin", "so that is why am using this on a natural sea sponge", "these are biodegradable sponges that you can also find at most health food stores or you can find them online", "you can buy them in bulk if you want", "but this is a really great body wash and if you are in a pinch you can use it as a shampoo as well", "so it kind of doubles as those next", "we are going to be making a facial cleanser for the facial cleanser", "you need three ingredients you are going to do equal parts aloe vera gel sweet almond oil and", "then one or two drops of tea tree oil", "so this is more of like an oil cleanser but the tea tree oil is actually great for acne and it is an antiseptic on the skin and have antiseptic properties so it is really great for the skin overall", "and it can help soothe the skin and reduce redness and acne breakouts and things like that", "so you can use this as a facial cleanser", "one or two drops is plenty because tea tree oil is very strong", "if you make this cleanser without tea tree oil you can put it in a plastic container generally when you are using essential oils you want to use a glass container", "but it actually does suds up and", "it works really great as a facial cleanser", "so next we are making a facial toner", "this again is extremely easy to make and for this all you need is two parts water and one part aloe vera", "so that is why am putting the aloe vera", "actually I have a little straw here", "and I am putting the aloe vera in the water", "and then I am going to shake that up and that makes a really nice setting spray or facial toner and it definitely is hydrating and plumping to the skin", "so after you spray it you can kind of tap it into your skin and you will feel a nice hydration plumping of the skin afterwards let is move on to another favorite ingredient which is coconut oil", "I have shown how you can put coconut oil in your hair and on your scalp which makes a great beauty treatment today", "we are making an all purpose beauty balm which is again very easy to make", "but it has a base of coconut oil so that is why have fourth of a cup of organic cold pressed coconut oil 1 tablespoon of beeswax", "and I am basically going to heat that over a double boiler I have shown this process on my channel multiple times", "but basically you have a pan with hot water and", "then a bowl on top of that pan that is ok to get heated obviously", "and I am going to melt the coconut oil and the beeswax together", "coconut oil melts much faster than beeswax", "so that is why have to be patient and wait for the beeswax", "and then I pull it off", "wait for it to cool down and add 1 4 TSP of vitamin E oil", "and then I am going to add that into a lip balm jar or two in this case", "I was going to take a funnel and gently pour the mixture into the lip", "balm jars close them up and then just let those harden and you have a easy and very effective all purpose balm you can add essential oils if you want to", "but I liked it simple like this", "you can throw this in your bag once it is had a chance to harden up after about 6 to 8 hours", "and you can use this for your lips for dry elbows you can even use it for scars you can pretty much use it for anything for cuticles it works great for the ends of your hair to prevent split", "ends it kind of does everything", "so next we are making a moisturizing and healing face mask", "so this doubles as a face mask and a moisturizer so after you use this", "you do not need to use a moisturizer if you do not want to so for this", "we are just adding equal parts honey and coconut oil", "I am going to mix it well and incorporate the two together if you have oily prone skin you may not like this", "it may irritate it", "but I will say honey has antiseptic properties so that is why may like it", "so you could give it a try and see or you could do a little test on the side of your skin and see how it feels", "but I am going to mix that together really well and apply that onto my skin after I use this like I said I personally did not feel like I needed a moisturizer so that is why applied that after a shower left it on for 15 to 20 minutes and then washed it with a little water next", "we are making three different body scrubs the first one I like to call oatmeal cookie so that is why am kind of eyeballing this", "I have equal part outs that I ground up in a food processor", "I have some brown sugar I am going to add some coconut oil mix", "that together this is the most wonderful scrub it smells divine", "and it is extremely hydrating", "so I actually use this on my legs", "but I also used it on my bellies", "I like to really exfoliate my belly and my thighs and everything to prevent from stretch marks while I am pregnant so that is why like that one that one was by far my favorite next", "I am making a banana bread scrub if you do not like the feel of banana", "you may not like this and banana is used for hair masks and all sorts of different things when it comes to DIY beauty", "and it is not for everyone", "but if you do not mind you might like this one", "so I am smashing up a half of a banana adding some coconut oil and then adding some sugar you can add brown sugar if you want", "but in this case I am just adding a little bit of white sugar", "and I am mixing it together really well", "and this is", "kind of this is more of a fine scrub and it is a little bit more gentle", "so if you have sensitive skin that might be more appropriate and then next we are making a matcha green tea scrub I am adding equal parts Epsom salt some matcha powder a little bit of baking soda and I am also going to add some coconut oil", "and I am going to mix this all together so that I have my green tea scrub this will leave your legs and body a little bit green", "but only until you wash your body", "so I recommend using this before you use your body wash so scrub with it and then use a body wash this one is definitely this strong", "it", "well I would say the oatmeal cookie is definitely a strong scrub as well", "but the Epsom salt makes this one pretty strong to clarify when I say strong", "I mean abrasive", "so this one is probably one of the more abrasive ones and if you do not have sensitive skin and you are looking for a really good scrub this is definitely the one for you or you can adjust it with different ingredients if you have sensitive skin but the green tea is really great for anti aging and this is a good scrub I liked this one and", "again I used it before my body wash and then washed my body and had no issues being green when I was finished so hopefully you guys enjoyed this video and these recipes

to my channel today we are doing another DIY dollar store video this one is going to be spring themed I am making a few fun spring themed items from the dollar store and obviously everything can be found at the dollar tree or a local dollar store", "but I found everything at the Dollar Tree", "so let is get started I am really excited about this video and will jump it in so we are starting with a very easy DIY", "this is DIY easy succulent pot makeover", "so basically we have these succulent pots and", "this is faux succulents you can find this at the dollar store so if you do not want to buy succulent you are worried about killing it you can buy fake succulents", "as well I like to kind of have a mixture I prefer", "to have live", "but sometimes it is nice to have fake flowers if they look real", "and I think these looks pretty good", "so what I am doing here is giving these succulent pots a little makeover with some twine and a hot glue gun so that is why can do this whether it is real or fake and you are wrapping the twine around the pot", "and you can do this with larger pots as well with bigger rope", "but in this case I am using twine", "and this is a great way to kind of spruce up", "anything make it look a little bit more rustic so again you can do this with live or you can do it with fake but in this case you can get both of these at the dollar store and make a really easy decor piece that is kind of a little bit more elevated", "and I think I am going to try this with rope for a bigger container that holds some of my plants but for now I am starting with these little ones", "I did three", "and I thought they looked cute", "and you can use these throughout the house or outside or wherever you think that they might look cute but taking the twine and wrapping it around with a little hot glue is going to definitely make it look a lot better next we are doing some shabby chic Easter decor", "we are making some eggs and carrots", "so there is a lot of different things you can do around Easter and spring", "but I liked the idea of making kind of rustic looking carrots so you are going to take some newspaper", "and you are going to wrap it up so that it has the shape of the carrot I am cutting the top of the newspaper so that it is about the length of a carrot", "and then I am going to take some tape", "make sure I tape that together", "and then I am going to take twine in this case I am taking obviously color twine", "so that is why got orange twine from the dollar store I am just going to that with the tape", "I have this looking like the shape of the carrot", "and then I am going to wrap that orange twine all the way around", "so this is a little bit more time consuming in the sense that it takes time to wrap it", "so that is why made two of these", "but I am going to wrap wrap wrap with a little bit of hot glue", "the glue does get a little stringy but that is very easy to remove", "and then you just wrap all the way around", "so that is why get to the very top and they also had kind of like a fake grass at the dollar store which I used for coming out of the top of the carrot so that it looked just like a carrot so that is why imagine using these kind of for a table decor or decor around the house around Easter if you are looking for a more festive Easter decor", "so I ended up making two of these", "and then I did something very similar with eggs which I will show you", "but", "but these are very easy fun to make with kids or with the family and in you know", "in the sense they are very very easy", "it is just kind of time consuming any obviously if you have kids around", "you want to someone is monitoring the hot glue gun my particular hot glue gun does not get overly hot though I will say it works pretty good", "and it is never burned me so that is kind of nice to get kind of a temperature controlled one", "but I thought that these looked fun", "and then I took that fake grass put them in the top", "and I had these great little carrots", "and then for eggs I got you can get the eggs at the dollar store", "and I used regular twine for that and then colored twine to decorate them", "so it is a little bit of a different take on decorating eggs there are so many different ideas and things you can do around the holiday", "but with this one I liked it because it was going for a more rustic shabby chic type decor which I thought was fun", "and I wanted to try this year", "so we are making a DIY spring wreath", "next everything again is from the dollar store I got a wreath frame and then some fake purple flowers which at first I was a little concerned that these would look super fake", "but as I put them in it looks really nice", "so that is why went ahead", "I put them all in the same direction in the wreath frame and then", "I also take some wire which you can also find at the dollar store and kind of tie them into the frame", "and then I try to spread out the colors evenly", "I went all the way around", "and then I took wire cutters", "I cut the ends so that they are not sticking out the bottom and then I went all the way around the entire wreath frame and tried to you know get the colors you know", "I would do like a white and then a dark purple and a light purple", "and I actually loved how this turned out sometimes when I start with these", "I worried that it might look too cheesy", "and I was happy with how this turned out so with a little wire and some fake flowers and a wreath frame you can make a nice affordable wreath", "and I set like", "this looked like I wanted to put it on my head and loved it", "I thought it looks so great", "I wanted to make like one for a little flower crown", "but I ended up putting this on the door", "and I thought it was really pretty and springy so that one was probably my favorite out of everything although I did like the succulents", "as well I thought that turned out pretty next", "I am making a DIY topiary tree centerpiece", "I have some floral foam and then a pot from the dollar store which I will admit the pot", "was a little bit flimsy so that is why might go for a different pot next time that is not from the dollar store", "but I like to try to do everything from the dollar store and", "I also wish I would have put some white paint and distressed it a little bit so it looked a little bit more rustic", "but I am taking two skewers putting it in the floral foam", "and then I got some fake leaves from the dollar store", "as well I am wrapping that around the skewers", "and then I am going to take the faux greenery ball which you can find at the dollar store as well", "and I am going to put that right on top", "now you can hot glue gun if you need to", "but I did not need to", "it just fit right on top", "and then I had some fake moss or grass that I am going to put over the foam", "so that is why can make one or two of these you can do one for a centerpiece", "and like I said I do wish I would have distressed it a little bit since things are from the dollar store", "it was a tiny bit flimsy", "so this is probably my least favorite to be honest although I do think it turned out pretty good for being from the dollar store", "but if I were to do it again", "I might take a stronger pot", "and you know try it out a little bit differently next time", "but anyway hopefully you guys enjoyed this video", "it gave you some good ideas of things that you can do that", "are from the dollar store and a little bit more affordable if you like my channel", "please be sure to subscribe for new

going to be making some tub tea as well", "so next time you take a bath you can have a few DIYs to try out", "so let is jump right in", "so let is start with the bass bones we are going to be making three coffee clay and aromatherapy so the base for a bass column is one cup of baking soda 1 2 of a cup of citric acid and 1 2 of a cup of Epsom salt", "I am going to be adding a few different things to make three distinct different bass balls I am starting with two tablespoons of coffee two tablespoons of bentonite clay and two tablespoons of powder eucalyptus", "so I just took dried eucalyptus I put it in a food processor", "and then I made sure it was powder", "I am dividing the bath balm base to each of these three", "so that is why am basically dividing it into thirds I am going to mix each of them very well", "and then I am going to add the wet ingredients let is say you do not want to add coffee or eucalyptus or the clay", "and you want to make a bath ball", "and as is you can add food coloring if you want you would take that base and then add the wet ingredients once the dry ingredients are thoroughly mixed it is time to add the wet ingredients so for the clay mixture I am actually adding some tea tree oil I am adding about three to four drops", "and then for the eucalyptus I am adding a little bit of peppermint and", "some lavender", "so this is great for achy muscles and the clay and tea tree oil", "is kind of like a detoxifying bath and", "obviously coffee is self explanatory", "I am not adding anything as far as the essential oils to that", "but that is caffeinated", "so it is going to wake you up", "and it is great for cellulite things like that", "okay", "so for the wet mixture what I have here is I have some almond oil", "and then I would say that is about three teaspoons of almond oil mixed with about one teaspoon of water and you are going to very slowly add to the dry mixture until the mixture kind of clumps together", "so that is why out you want to add it very slowly because you do not want it to start to fizz up", "you want that to wait until it is time for the bath", "so once I mix the wet ingredients I am going to put it in molds", "my molds are half molds", "I do not make full on bath bombs because I do not have the appropriate equipment for it", "but these work perfect and", "so that is why am starting with the coffee", "and I am going to be able to fit all of them in to that particular mold", "and I made about two of each", "so you can give them away as gifts or you can keep them around for whenever you are ready to use them these need to dry overnight for at least 8 to 10 hours", "and once they have had a chance to solidify they will easily pop out of the mold now I do recommend using silicone molds because that makes it a lot easier to get these to pop out", "so I have these little scoops", "I have two of the detox two of the aromatherapy and two of the coffee and again you can give them away as gifts if you want you can pack them up and put them in a mason jar or you can put them away in some kind of like cellophane and wrap it in a really cute bow", "or you can save them and use them", "and when you put them in the bath they will immediately start to fizz and dissolve in the bath", "and you can use whichever one", "you desire for whatever type of bath you want for that day next", "we are going to be making some tub teas I am making relaxing soothing and uplifting tub teas starting with relaxing", "so that is why get these great little sachets from Michaels or you get them at most stores", "sell them", "I have some oatmeal that has been put through the food processor equal parts oatmeal dried lavender and sea salt", "and then I am going to add a few drops of lavender essential oil", "and then I am going to kind of shake it up a little bit", "and you can put that right in the back or directly under the water as it flows so that is really easy for the relaxing tub tea", "the next one we are going to make is a soothing tub tea which has very similar ingredients I have some rosemary which I just got from my garden", "but you can use dried rosemary if you d like", "and then again I am using the oatmeal that has been through the food processor", "so it is very powdery", "and then I am also adding some dried chamomile", "so this is going to be a very kind of soothing and relaxing tea for the bath and again shaking it up", "and you can stick it directly in the back or directly into the faucet for the uplifting I am adding the dried oats", "and then I am going to be adding some green tea and some peppermint essential oil so equal parts of the oats and green tea and", "then about five drops of the peppermint oil and this is an uplifting tub tea", "this is also kind of like the coffee in the sense that it has a little bit of caffeine not as much as the coffee bath bomb", "but it is going to be a little bit more of an uplifting maybe daytime bath", "so these are very easy to make and they are fun", "I love tub teas they make for a relaxing experience", "and I usually stick them directly under the faucet", "and then you will notice the water starts to turn a tea color and", "it is like you are taking a tea bath", "so hopefully you guys enjoyed this video and", "you try out some of these recipes and let me know what you think please subscribe to my

or like little areas in my shower that I notice get kind of build up whether it is mold or mildew or build up in general", "this works great", "and then you can just use a toothbrush to kind of just scrub it and as you can see I had like a little green there", "so whatever was there", "is now gone", "and I try to keep my eye out for that because I actually had mold in my house growing up and we had to have like this whole big thing happen", "so mold freaks me out", "okay next we are moving on to a stovetop cleaner", "this is equal parts baking soda and olive oil and then you are going to put this on the area of your stove that kind of needs cleaning if you will", "where were tively clean because I do try to keep it pretty clean", "but you make a paste you apply it to the stovetop and allow it to set for several hours you can even leave it overnight for tough stains", "and then you can wash away using either vinegar or water so that is why am using water to wipe it away", "and you can see when I finish wiping that it definitely kind of cleans up any stains or rough areas on the stove that I was having a little trouble with", "I have a flat stove so it is a little bit easier", "I have had both I have had different types of stoves in my lifetime and this one is a little bit easier to clean", "but this did work pretty well", "I was actually pretty impressed with with how it worked", "I think I should have left it on a little longer", "I left it on for the purposes of filming this video for about an hour", "so that is why should have left it on a little bit longer next", "I am using this oven cleaner which blew me away", "it is basically baking soda and water and you are creating a paste I desperately needed to clean my oven", "it was so gross", "and I had kind of been avoiding it to be completely honest because it is a definite task", "so that is why made this baking soda paste when I open up the door of the oven", "you can see", "oh my gosh", "the window is in desperate need of cleaning so that is why did a little section so you guys can see the results of how well this worked so that is why put it on", "I let that fit for about a few hours", "and then I came back with a pretty big brush", "and I I had to put some elbow grease into it to definitely start to loosen up whatever was on there", "and you can definitely see that it does clean up very well nothing works as good as this has worked because I have tried a few methods I am going to go over it", "one more time obviously clean the whole thing and then go over it one more time", "so it is extra clean but", "that really really worked that was probably", "my favorite one so good old baking soda really does the job so that cleaned up the oven", "and then finally we are going to make a tub scrub I have made a variety of body scrubs on my channel", "but I do not think I have ever made a tub scrub I am using baking soda salt and some natural dish soap", "and I am creating a paste so I will put the exact ratio in the description", "but this is a really easy way to clean your bathtub", "and you can use it by itself with a you know some sort of paper towel or like what I was using those kind of microfiber wipes or if you want to go in a little bit more intense for the Polish you can use a brush", "I also would recommend if you have jets inside your bathtub to have a toothbrush", "and I mentioned this in my bathroom cleaning video if you are using scrubs or products in the bath in general things tend to get inside the Jets and it is important to clean those out", "and I showed a few more ways to clean out your bathtub in that video but this scrub works well for just polishing up the bathtub cleaning all those Jets and the little areas and things like that or if it really needs a good scrub down and clean alright", "so next we are moving into natural spring decor I wanted to show you guys a few things I am replanting this little cement container which I absolutely love I just love this look", "I did a succulents in a smaller cement container in my how to make your bathroom look like a spa video", "and I actually recently got some aloe vera for the summertime I am going to do some DIY using aloe vera very soon", "but I wanted to plant it", "and I use the rest of the succulents that I did have", "so I use some of it for that I like to use this inside the house either as a centerpiece or on a window sill", "but you could keep it outside", "and I do bring my succulents outside twice a week", "and I put it in the shade so that you know it helps it stay alive a lot longer", "and it is a little harder to kill succulents in general", "anyway", "but this I thought this looked pretty and then also I love to do lemon simple very simple as putting lemons in a vase", "it is a quick and easy way to just brighten up the room", "make it look like spring and summer in the spring and summer", "I always do that and then in the spring I pick up tulips instead of hydrangeas usually when I go to the grocery store", "I like to mix and match a few different colors", "and then I put those in mason jars I am doing two in this case", "and it is easy", "I mean if you have mason jars you have some lemons", "and then you pick up some tulips you have a quick and easy centerpiece that looks very spring very summer", "and you can also wrap the mason jars and burlap and that is also another cute way to liven up the centerpiece", "and it is easy and again right away it just if you have people coming over or you want to make your house look vibrant and springy after you have cleaned it", "I love this idea so that is why am taking a little bit of glue and gluing the burlap around the mason jar", "it does not touch the mason jar so that is why can take it off if you want", "but I think that that looks really cute and then finally wheatgrass is usually something you can get", "and you can juice it does need to be referred", "but if you have people coming over and you want kind of like a pop of color in your house I like to put wheatgrass in a container and put it on by the Sun in the windowsill", "or you can plant it", "and there is", "I will put a Pinterest link on how you can plant it", "but that looks great and springing as well", "and that is a quick and easy thing", "and then you put it in the refrigerator", "and you can juice it and have wheatgrass shots so that is why can make wheatgrass shots for your guests", "so anyway that kind of completes", "my first installment for spring cleaning and a little bit of decor I am going to do more of this as we move full steam ahead into spring hopefully you guys enjoyed this video", "and I will see you guys in the next one", "bye"], "fiEKofWmpUo": ["hey guys welcome back to my channel", "alright", "so today I am doing an updated morning routine today", "is morning routine is going to be a stay at home morning routine so this is going to show you a day when I am actually not going out", "so keep that in mind", "but every day pretty much starts between", "6 30 and 7 30 sometimes if we are lucky and we can sleep in he will sleep until 8 00", "but usually it is about seven o clock on the dot that he gets up comes into our bed gives us hugs usually talks to us", "we blab for about 15 minutes or so", "and then he lets us know that he is hungry", "so depending on what is going on for the day it will either be me or Byron making him breakfast", "and it usually varies what we make him", "but on most days I d say probably 75 of the time he will have oatmeal", "so that is why make him some rolled oats", "I add a little bit of Earth Balance butter some cinnamon", "and then I add some maple syrup", "my preference is to use 100 pure maple syrup when sweetening my oatmeal most people prefer oatmeal sweet", "it is kind of bland if you do not sweeten it", "but this has some minerals that are a little bit healthier than sugar", "I mix that all together", "and then I will usually give him a side of berries a little bowl of berries depending on what we have", "his favorite is blackberries but I will do blueberries strawberries whatever we happen to have and the refrigerator for that week", "so that is kind of what we serve him on most mornings", "and it kind of varies", "if you stay to the end of this video I will add a few more recipes that we like to use because every day is a little bit different you", "we get a fruit and veggie box", "and then they will actually got our first one last week", "and we got tons of fruit and veggies so that is why started using some carrot celery", "I will usually put one or two apples in there", "I share the juice with him so that is why let him have a few sips with his breakfast", "but he is definitely not going to drink that whole thing I am gonna steal it from him and take it let him finish his oatmeal", "and then I usually tried to wash my face real quick and", "kind of do my little routine which if I am staying home to be honest I am lucky if I even do this", "I definitely do not wear makeup around the house or anything like that if I am going out", "so right now I am using a vitamin C brightening cleanser", "I actually braided my hair the night before I took a shower and braids in my hair so that is why am going to take the braids out", "and then after take the braids out I am going to put a little bit of moisturizer I was using Kate Somerville serum", "but I ran out of it", "so right now I am using the dr", "Perricone cold plasma", "I really like his products this particular one that you do not use artificial fragrances in the product so that is why have kind of a unique smell", "and you have to kind of get past that", "but they are excellent", "and I love this base cream I have used it before in the past", "so that is why am kind of circling back to using it", "and then I am going to brush my teeth with my Sonicare", "I love that thing I have not been as good about this as I would like lately because I have been kind of sick", "but we have been kind of doing the morning routine of doing schooling", "so that is why have three books I got for him", "we got through one of the workbooks which was the three year old workbook", "now we are going through the four", "and it is kind of like preschool prep", "so that is why would not say we do this every day", "but I was trying to get into the pattern of doing this every morning", "and we d have it like with juice right after his breakfast so that is why was like really alert", "and it is been helping him", "and I think it is helping to prepare him for preschool when he does go three four", "and then I usually do the dishes clean up while he plays", "and then I take it outside usually to play around outside for a few hours if it is a good nice day", "and that is kind of it", "like I know it is probably boring so that is why wanted to share with you guys in this video some other morning recipes that we like because every morning varies and we do not eat the same thing every day", "so the first one I wanted to share with you guys is Chia juice", "when we are doing his school I usually do make him a juice as like a motivation every time he gets an answer right and like take a sip of your juice", "you know", "so that is why love Chia but", "it is kind of expensive", "so the first thing to do to make it at home is to hydrate your chia seeds what I am doing", "is I have two cups of water to two tablespoons of chia seeds so it is one tablespoon per one cup", "and I am making two cups so", "the key here is I am putting it in mason jar you want to put a top on", "and you want to shake it", "so that is why kept it out and kept shaking it shaking it shaking its shaking it shaking it", "and then I put it in the refrigerator for about twenty to thirty minutes so that is why definitely want to shake it real good", "and then you will see it starts to kind of gelatinize", "and then I am adding blackberry juice and lemonade from Trader Joe", "is I got this recipe from Pinterest", "so that is why am definitely going to let you guys know", "where I got this this was not like an original recipe I looked around for a few different ones and", "this one is the one I tried that really works", "and then so that is why am doing half juice and half the Chia if you do exactly half juice and half Chia", "you will have enough", "but I think I might do less juice and more hydrated chia seeds next time because I like the Chia", "and I like it to be less sweet", "I usually water down his juice anyway", "but you stick those in the refrigerator", "and they are like ma Matias", "they are so good and they definitely save you some money because those can add up", "okay", "so next I am making some peanut butter and banana toast", "if I am not making oatmeal for Oliver I will usually make in something like this it is very easy I am taking some multigrain toast", "I have some Justin is peanut butter", "I am putting some bananas on there", "and then I will also add some fruit whatever we do have so on this particular morning", "this is actually what I ate for breakfast but some mornings I will have oatmeal and he will have this", "and it kind of varies depending on the day the next thing I like", "is", "these peanut butter Chia protein balls these are not so much of a breakfast", "but something I will make to have around four if we leave", "and I want something to snack kind of ride me of like homemade Larabars or something like that", "so that is why have rolled oats peanut butter", "I am going to add some coconut flakes some honey", "some vanilla", "and then I am going to add some chia seeds and some vegan chocolate chips", "so mix this all together you can create little balls or little bars and these are great for kind of on the go for me", "I like I mentioned in my last video", "I have been getting faint", "so I like to have something high protein in the morning and then try to have something to snack on with me at all times", "so this is something good to just have in case", "my blood sugar starts to feel low and they are great to snack on plus

know that I was able to switch my health insurance over my if you watched my last video", "you know I was having a little bit of drama and", "a lot of you guys were kind of confused about that health care insurance kind of changed overall as a result of the Affordable Health Care Act so basically it is", "kind of like I am not going to go into that", "but anyway we got dropped from our PPO and when I tried to call and sign up for another PPO they were like we do not offer PP o", "is anymore in California which a PPO is essentially you can go to any doctor you want for the most part who takes your health insurance so that is why do not have to be restricted", "my ob gyn that I really wanted to go to he is all the way in one part of", "you know where I live", "it is like he was like 30 minutes away", "and then there is like an ear nose and throat doctor", "I like to go to that", "is over here where we live and", "so that is why can kind of pick and choose your doctor if you do not have a PPO which they do not offer very many PPOs", "anymore I think with everything going on health care insurance companies are becoming finicky we went with Kaiser which Kaiser is a group of doctors it is like a group of hospitals and a group of doctors and you can go see the doctors that work for Kaiser you ca not go and see any other doctors I had a doctor I really liked for Kaiser my general practitioner", "but he retired this year", "so that was kind of a bummer and Byron", "had Kaiser before and we liked it this time around you know the way that it worked", "was", "the ob gyn was you would go there", "and you would see a doctor", "but you are not guaranteed to necessarily see that doctor next time and", "that is not really the guarantee doctor that is going to deliver your baby", "and if you have an emergency you are not guaranteed to talk to that doctor so that is why end up getting a lot of different opinions from different they work as a team", "but I felt that every doctor gave me different opinions and it was like mixed", "so that is why actually found the one PPO that they offer in California they do not offer any other PPOs and", "I decided to go with that

day", "seven days a week I am always available for you", "and so that is why can page him", "and I will call you back", "it is just such good if you do have an emergency or you are scared about

something that I always envisioned probably from the age of like six or seven", "I had like this", "you know vision of my future", "and I always imagined myself being a mama", "is boy", "so that is

am mixing that all together you can put more or less lavender whatever you prefer", "and then I am going to pour that mixture into the socks you are going to need enough to pretty much fill up the socks not all the way", "but most of the way the long pair of socks is ideal because these are neck warmer", "so that is why are going to go around the back of your neck", "and so basically I am going to pour that mixture into the socks I am going to tie it with some twine", "and then you can throw these in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time keeping a very close eye on them depending on how hot your microwave is you want to", "you keep a very close eye and start with 30 seconds", "and if it is not warm enough you can do 10 seconds 10 seconds 10 seconds until it gets warm", "you want to be

time", "it is really had a chance to infuse into the oil so the oil is going to smell really nice and relaxing after it is had a chance to infuse", "then I am going to take the top off I am going to put some cheesecloth over it", "and then I am just going to strain it", "and I am going to put it into one of these dropper bottles", "and then you can use it for a body oil but more specifically for

like a hot chocolate bar or a fondue menu like I am doing here", "I am just going to put what we have on the menu which is milk chocolate dark chocolate white chocolate and Nutella", "so it is gonna be like a Nutella blend", "so that is why have four mason jars I am going to fill up the mason jars with the chocolate chips in the different flavors", "so that is why have the milk chocolate chips here and some Ghirardelli milk chocolate chips", "then I have some dark white and Nutella", "so that is why am getting this all prepped in the day", "it is not quite time to put it in the crock pot", "yet", "but I am going to show you that", "in a little bit so if you get everything kind of prepped that you keep the Nutella and cream mixture in the refrigerator because you do not want that to go bad", "so next we are going to be making a DIY love spell scented so a candle", "now I have made a candle before on my channel recently", "so I am going to put the instructions on how to make a soy candle in the description because I have shown this before I am just using the soy candle wax", "and then I am going to melt that in a double boiler now for this candle I am kind of going to do

am using love spell fragrance which I special ordered", "this is the fragrance I used when we were dating any time he smells it", "he says it reminds him of when we first met", "so I thought it would

to be putting the chocolate in the crock pot", "I added water", "I actually emptied out a little bit because you want to add water about halfway to three quarters of the way up and just let the chocolate melt on high in the crock pot so once the chocolate is melted you can bring it out set it down", "and then I compiled some chopped bananas strawberries marshmallows you can do graham

transform your bathroom", "you will feel the most at peace in your new spa like bathroom when it is clean and tidy", "so first things first is to clear your counters organize anything that is messy or unattractive put them into drawers and you can use dividers if you want to kind of organize things in your drawers but keep a few things on the counter you definitely want a very clean environment so that is why am wiping down everything with this all purpose spray from honest nice and sparkly", "and then my next tip is to take economy sized shampoo conditioner and body washes so the biggest sizes you can find and transfer them to these sleek bottles so that your shower looks nice and clean these come in glass", "but they also come in plastic which is probably a little bit better for the shower you can find them BPA free you can find them on Amazon", "but ideally you do want to be using economy size because if you are just transferring from a shampoo bottle to this it is kind of a waste because you are using two different bottles", "so the idea is that you buy a really large bottle and refill it", "and then I just do shampoo conditioner body wash", "so I know what everything is", "and then you have this nice sleek design in the shower", "my next tip would be to add plants and flowers I had my husband come in because I am four months pregnant", "and I did not want to fall", "so that is why helped me hang up this hanging plant that I got from Home Depot", "I would recommend having a chat with whomever works at the nursery that you are going to whether it is the Home Depot nursery or a nursery near you and just ask them which plants will thrive best in your bathroom my bathroom gets a little bit of light so that is why chose two that will work in the bathroom", "I have one on the stand and one that I hung over the bathtub", "and then I am gonna make two different succulent arrangements I actually ordered the succulents online", "but you can certainly get it in a nursery they delivered", "I ordered it on Amazon they delivered these little succulent pods to me the next day in a beautiful box", "I have the succulent soil that I get at Home Depot", "I got this great little ceramic vase that I am gonna put the succulents in", "so basically I pulled the succulents out of the pot I break it up a little bit", "and then you are just going to push it into the soil for this particular one", "I will choose three that will fit in here this fits three and this is gonna go on my bathtub", "I have a little bathtub tray which I will show you in a second", "so that is why made that one for that", "then I am gonna make this second one I got this great kind of cement vase at Target", "so that is why can find that there", "and then I am putting the succulents oil and they are filling it to the top", "and then I like to arrange before I put it in there", "which ones I think will look pretty together", "and then I am doing the same thing you kind of loosen the bottom a little bit so that you expose some of the roots", "and then you want to", "you dig a little hole in the soil and it has space and then after that I am going to water it", "these are

another crystal", "and I am just gonna add some pretty ceramic trays with soaps on either side of the sink", "gonna put some river rocks down there", "I have some fresh soap that I am gonna put on

same steps and habit so that is why am going to do a DIY", "and I am going to share with you a few things that I do for my routine", "so let is just go for it", "all right", "so that is why am going to start this video with a do it yourself belly butter", "I tried a bunch of different ones in my first pregnancy", "but I wanted to make some homemade belly better this time around", "so I am actually adding two tablespoons of shea butter", "I am adding two tablespoons of cocoa butter now these are a little harder to get out of the container so that is why put my containers in hot water so that they can melt and it can make it a little bit easier for me to add it so", "the cocoa butter pretty much melted I am adding the beeswax this is going to thicken your butter as well as provide a protective barrier that holds the moisture into the skin", "but it is optional", "you do not have to use it if you do not want I am adding coconut oil", "and then I am going to add sweet almond oil which has vitamin A and vitamin E", "those are powerful antioxidants that keep the skin supple and looking young so basically I am putting all these together in a double boiler I am going to gently melt those on a low temperature", "so a double boiler basically has the water boiling underneath", "and then a separate Bowl on top after that has finished completely melting I am going to pour that into a glass bowl", "and I am going to let that start to cool down", "and it is going to harden a little bit", "then I am going to add some vitamin E oil about 10 drops", "I am going to add some neroli essential oil which is a really powerful oil that helps reduce the appearance of stretch marks and scars it is used in a lot of kind of pregnancy belly butters", "if you will next I am adding helichrysum essential oil which is a very powerful essential oil that is known for fading and hearing scars surgical wounds and stretch marks both of these essential oils are totally optional they can be expensive so if you are not going to be making batches and batches of this belly butter it may not be worth it", "but I know these belly butters over the course of nine months can add up but honestly even if you just mix the cocoa butter", "the shea butter coconut oil vitamin E and sweet almond oil together that is going to be a really amazing belly butter", "so that is why will talk about that a little bit more in a bit the next I want to share with you guys", "kind of what my a m routine has been what I have been focusing on during this pregnancy first thing is to drink a lot of water", "and I talk about this a lot in my videos", "but I have a hard time with they actually got this bottle on Amazon", "I was super duper nauseous for the first few months and was not feeling in the mood to drink water", "this is great to help you track it", "it tells you how much you need to drink per hour", "and then you need to refill it a total of three times", "so the goal is to drink three of these which to be quite honest", "I have a really hard time doing", "but it is a good reminder and you can find these on Amazon if you need help tracking your water intake", "the next thing is just snacking healthy once I got over just whatever I was in the mood for that", "did not make me feel nauseous", "I started trying to eat things that my doctor recommended they give me like a little recommendation sheet of things I should be eating so that is why do have Greek yogurt and berries if you do not like yogurt definitely lots of berries um fresh fruit", "and you know I have a weird taste in my mouth whenever I am pregnant and", "so fresh fruit is always something I really really want because it gets that taste out of my mouth", "I do not know how to describe it like a metallic you type taste", "I get I have gotten it with both my pregnancies", "so I also boil some eggs I will put out some veggies and", "maybe some like ranch dressing some nuts just things that I can snack on obviously", "I will refrigerate these if I am not going to eat them right away", "but I try to make some easy to reach snacks so as of lately those are my two main focuses in the daytime

bed all day for the nighttime", "I do take my showers at night after I put my son to sleep normally", "and I do like to diffuse some essential oils right now I am using the vanilla because I like the smell for shampoo", "I have been using echo Bella", "this is the vanilla shampoo you can find it at Whole Foods or natural food stores", "but I actually get it on Amazon Prime which is where I get a lot of items lately", "and then I am using the coconut milk conditioner by OGX", "or I think it is called organics you can find that at Ulta or most I think Target has it too", "but I like this", "so that is why am using that", "but I am using a tart cleanser with my Clarisonic Mia fit", "I do not use my Clarisonic every single day but", "usually when I shower I use it", "and I like the NIA fit",

breakouts I have been using the green apple peel by Juice Beauty", "this is specifically for pregnancy it actually says on there pregnancy", "and it is a very kind of mild peel again", "I do break out my skin texture is a little bit different probably because I am not using retinol and glycolics and things like that so my skin changes a little bit", "so these products have been really good for kind of combating all of that", "I recommend dry brushing whether you are pregnant or not", "but when you are pregnant you want to be gentle", "but you can do it in all the areas of concern that you are concerned for stretch marks it does bring blood flow to the area", "and I would recommend exfoliating in general whether it is with gloves or with dry brushing so that is why like to apply lotion I am using the echo Bella vanilla lotion which is a natural lotion again you can find this at Whole Foods or natural food stores putting this on my legs and my arms but for my bum and my belly and for my

using the Kate Somerville quench oil free for several months", "so that is why just recommend this in general", "it is a really great product I like", "that it is oil free", "does not cause breakouts but it is the perfect perfect fit for my skin right now", "and then it is about 7 30", "so I am trying to keep up with my water intake and", "about this time I start winding down", "I take my prenatals I have been taking these new chapter multivitamins", "and then I have been taking a prenatal DHA because the multivitamin does not have a DHA in it so that is why take one of the DHA s and",

it", "I am actually just about empty so if you have a recommendation for a multivitamin that is just one I would love that if you put that in the comments below so that is why try to finish up my

clean", "it is not always organized and that is because I have like a normal house", "it is too hard to keep it clean and organized at all times", "so hopefully you know you guys know that", "but if you do not I want to put it out there that my house definitely is not clean and organized at all times without being said I definitely like to keep it as clean as possible and as organized as possible", "I think I start to go a little nuts when there is a lot of clutter", "you know I feel like it is going to get a little bit worse because I am getting ready to have another kids", "but I have a three year old", "and he is always playing and the one thing I do not want to be because I have seen kind of both ends of the spectrum I have seen super clean houses that always look perfect

that", "all the time which I feel like sometimes you have to be in order to keep it that pristine at all times", "I also do not want to let it go and not care because sometimes you can feel like I am

think it is important if you are not living by yourself and you are living with other people", "I think it is important to delegate to say like hey can you do the dishes today", "or you know buyer is really good about doing the dishes because he works in the kitchen a lot", "and so that is why kind of cleans up after himself", "and we kind of have gotten our groove after 10 years of being married

to try to kind of get back on track the first thing that I like to do", "is I try to make a schedule", "and I try to spend goals and", "this is kind of like with anything in my life", "I would say for the most part I like to write things down", "I do try to", "I have not been as much in my planner lately because I have not been doing as much because I have really been taking it easy", "I personally think it is important to make your goals visible to you so that is why created these little custom templates that are in this video", "but they are going to be on my blog", "you can print them out and they should print out full size so that is why guys can have them take them", "print them tell somebody else about them", "I want them to be useful to you", "obviously they are free so for me", "I think it is important to have daily goals when it comes to cleaning because it is not realistic to clean your whole house start to finish every single day not going to happen in a million years especially when you have kids you have a job", "your life like nothing happened so", "the thing that I think is there is like your basics like wake up in the morning is generally a load of dishes that you do not need to be put away or from the night before you went to sleep and forgot to do it", "so it is kind of like first thing first dishes generally cleaning the floors mopping the floor", "so there is about four or five things that need to be done every day and if you a lot a little bit of time first thing in the morning or whatever that is", "maybe it is when you get home from work", "or maybe it is in the middle of the day when your kid is taking a nap", "whatever that might be the timing is totally up to you but just making a time that you can get these cleaning goals done", "so this is a list that you can make", "and you can write out your cleaning goals for the day", "and then you can do your monthly cleaning goals", "and so that is why you can kind of stay on top of your cleaning goals", "and you do not get overwhelmed", "you do not necessarily get behind", "so that is why can print that out", "I put on my refrigerator so that is why everybody can see it", "so it is not you either like you can put that up and say hey these are five things that need to be done every day you can delegate to your kids if they are older", "you can you know do chores", "and you can let your spouse know", "or your partner know", "hey like these are the things that need to be done every day", "can you help me out with it", "the other one is making like a little post it goal board", "and I have talked about this kind of before on my channel which is basically taking post its and just writing out your daily goals or the goals that you d like to accomplish over the next few days", "I also have another little printout where you can print that out", "and it has little spots to put your post it", "so when you are done accomplishing a goal you pull off the post it move a new post it to the top", "and there you have your kind of goals that you want to get done for the day whatever it is that you need to get done for that day", "whatever is the top priority you can see it",

you do not feel so overwhelmed because sometimes my goal is get lost biggest get lost appear somewhere the next tip is to purge", "and I do this", "all the time I try to do this cough every few months I would recommend doing like room by room or category", "so maybe today you want to purge all beauty products so with beauty products", "you know there is generally a time frame in which you can keep them and also on the back of the bottle", "it shows you you know how long you can keep it before you need to throw it away", "so that is why will often go through my beauty products every 3 4 months and just purge and get rid of whatever I can I also made a printout with the timeframe of which you want to throw beauty products out", "so be sure to print that out", "and you can kind of see and go through all your beauty products", "but today I did go through a bunch of beauty products throw them away get rid of old stuff", "and that is definitely a relief in your bathroom because I can get kind of cluttered", "I also went through kids toys", "I would highly recommend making two boxes a trash box and a purge box with the trash box", "basically I go around my house", "and I do not know about you", "but I am surprised at how much plain old trash is around the house like I would not say my house has like a lot of trash", "but yet when you go around and you realize like I got this box because we got something delivered from Amazon", "or I got this over here like", "that needs to be thrown away after Christmas", "it was kind of nuts", "so I just went through and literally just filled the entire box with things around the house that needs to be thrown away point blank", "and then I did a lot of donating", "as well I donated a lot of Oliver toys even some that you still plays with because he got so many for Christmas", "and I thought he is not going to miss these and his troops", "he did not miss them so", "and I recently did a closet have done a video on that", "so I did not go through my closet because I recently did that", "but you can do a closet purge you can do bedroom by bedroom go through your kids", "bedrooms go through the garage", "you know I would say do one goal at a time try not to purge your whole house maybe in one day but for me I was focusing on beauty products and my son is toys so the other thing I would recommend is as soon as you are done with all the donations putting everything in the box", "immediately put it in your car", "and then it is in your car next time you pass by wherever you want to donate it", "it is there and ready to go", "so those are kind of like my quick tips to get you started and in the mood for purging and organizing your house I am again doing these videos to inspire myself because I fall off the wagon all the freaking time", "and I feel like I am doing the same thing over and over again", "but it is such a relief to purge", "it is a relief to kind of re evaluate your goals in your schedule at least for me", "and so that is what I want to share with you guys I love a clean house when I love an organized house and a welcoming house", "and I wish my house could look like you know Better Homes and Gardens at all times but scope it", "I want my kids to remember their childhood fondly", "and I do not want them to be like my house was clean", "but my mom was a grump", "you know", "so anyways I

been trying to do the same here in our house", "everybody is kind of been feeling colds and flus coming up and we have been trying to avoid it at all costs so today I want to share with you guys a few hack recipes that I use when I am trying to avoid a cold or", "when I have one we are going to start with some do it yourself cough drops some delicious cold busting soup and then finally we are making a cold busting shot this packs quite the punch", "but it does kick a cold in the butt", "and I think it is delicious quite tart but very delicious", "alright", "so let is jump right in starting with the DIY cough drops this recipe is not too complicated I am starting with 3 4 of a cup of water", "and I am going to bring that to a boil I am going to take some chamomile lemon tea and some peppermint tea", "I am going to put those tea bags in there while the water is boiling and brew a cup of a combination of these two teas you can do this in a cup if you want bring that to a boil", "but I am doing it on this pan here because I am going to add a few things to the pan as well afterwards", "so I am going to let that come to a boil I am going to let that steep", "and then I am going to add some ginger and some cinnamon I am doing about half of a teaspoon of ginger and cinnamon", "and this is a ground ginger and cinnamon next", "I am going to be adding equal parts honey", "so 3 4 of a cup of honey", "my son is always very curious what I am making when I film these videos always curious if it is something for him", "anyway I am going to be bringing this mixture to a boil and you can either use a candy thermometer", "or I have an infrared thermometer because my husband happens to cook a lot and use that", "so I am testing it out to", "it reaches 300 degrees so that is why am watching it carefully", "and it can easily burn when it gets hot so that is why want to", "it does not burn", "but I am going to let that mixture cool for five to ten minutes until it starts to get a syrupy texture", "and then I am going to take a spoon and create little drops so that is why am going to let these dry you can stick them in the refrigerator or the freezer to help that process along a little bit", "but I by taking a spoon you can try to make as even as possible cough drops they wo not all be perfect but that is kind of the point of doing these yourself and", "so anyway the trick to helping them not stick together is by putting a little bit of cornstarch on these after they have had a chance to harden fully so after I pulled them out of the freezer they were hardened", "and I put a little bit of cornstarch on these", "and then you can put these in a container and they taste delicious and these recipes are all over the place I have seen them everywhere on Pinterest I have also seen them on Facebook", "and there is a bunch of different versions I am going to put where I got this version because this was not an original recipe I did not think of this in my head", "I found it and wanted to try it out", "and I liked it", "I think there is a few different variations some people put essential oils in theirs", "I did not for this one", "but I might try experimenting with different variations in the future", "but I wanted to try this one out", "test it out tell you how I liked it", "and hopefully you guys will like it too", "okay", "so next I am going to move on to a cold busting soup", "I think one thing that everybody always loves when they are not feeling well is some soup and you can customize this depending on your dietary needs", "but I am starting here with a little bit of olive oil", "I am going to roast up some garlic here", "I am gonna get that nice and brown", "and after that I am going to add some chicken broth", "now you can add veggie broth if you prefer but chicken broth I do feel is like the magic elixir for healing a cold and it just is delicious so that is why went ahead and added that this particular chicken broth is a little bit bland", "I get it at sprouts", "I prefer Swanson so that is why am adding a little bit of salt and pepper to that", "I would not normally do it if it was the Swanson chicken broth", "but I do always add almost a full lemon to my chicken broth because I love lemon in my chicken broth and in my soups I am adding some dried thyme and parsley you can kind of customize depending on which dried herbs you have and which ones you like going to mix those in there", "and then I am also going to add a little bit of cayenne pepper I love spicy in this case", "I am making a veggie soup with the chicken broth and", "I am putting some cauliflower in there and some kale", "and I am going to go ahead and put the cauliflower in there", "first bring that to a boil and kind of let that soften first because kale softens pretty fast and so that is why am going to go ahead and do that for about five to eight minutes", "then I am going to tear up some kale and put that in there let that soften and boil it for another about five minutes or so", "and then you can enjoy your soup perfect for if you feel a cold coming on or if you already have a cold you are not feeling good", "you can make this for yourself you can make this for someone else and again with all my recipes all my DIYs", "I always say customize it to be something you enjoy something that works with your diet and putting a little bit of more lemon in there because I love lemon", "and then I am going to enjoy that soup last but certainly not least", "we are making a cold busting juice shot I am starting by juicing three lemons and some garlic you can use whatever amount of garlic", "you feel comfortable with", "I usually cut if I see in a recipe that there is a lot of garlic", "I usually cut it because garlic is intense but when you are trying to avoid getting sick or you are sick garlic is a miracle worker so that is why am putting a little bit of garlic in there", "I am also going to put some ginger in the juicer and then at the bottom of the mason jar I already have approximately two tablespoons maybe a little bit less of honey depending on how sweet you want it because this is pretty tart", "and then I am adding equal parts pineapple juice to this", "and so basically equal parts to what you have with the lemon already", "and I am adding a little bit of cayenne pepper stirring it up good", "and you can drink this as quickly as possible", "it is definitely tart even with the honey", "but it gives your cold a kick in the butt", "I actually gave this to Byron because he felt a cold coming on and you can definitely taste the garlic so if you want to omit the garlic you can but the garlic packs a punch for getting rid of that cold coming on", "so anyway hopefully you guys enjoyed this video if you feel like you have a cold which I feel like a lot of us are struggling with colds this season try out some of these hacks see if they work for you thanks so much for watching my channel check out my last

a DIY store cloud", "so let is dump it in definitely not the first person to ever attempt making DIY kinetic sand on the Internet", "and it is actually harder than it looks", "I bought some for my son for Christmas", "but I wanted to attempt making it", "so I started with a 1 2 of a cup of corn starch 1 3 of a cup of dish soap and 1 tablespoon of water", "and I mix that together until it created a paste", "and then I slowly added sand in there", "now you can add some food coloring to the cornstarch and dish soap mixture", "but I tried a few different variations of this and um the ones with food coloring just get so messy and all over your hands", "so that is why decided to avoid that altogether but the dish soap did create a little bit of a kind of baby powder blue color as I added in the sand the color got a little grosser and grosser as I went along", "but um this ended up turning out pretty cool", "I would say it is a combination between like a play doh and kinetic sand the kinetic sand that you get from the store has this kind of like it falls through your hands", "it has this really cool unique texture", "and I tried three or four versions of making this", "and this was the closest to that", "but still not a hundred percent like the ones you can get in the store if you want to try this out with your kids", "it is still fun", "you can make all sorts of different shapes and you can also kind of slice it and have a lot of fun with it", "so that is what I did here", "it is a little bit messy not too messy but a little bit", "so I like to do it over a paper bag", "but next I am making some color pattern blocks so for this it is pretty easy", "you just want some non toxic paint and some wooden blocks you can find that at Michaels and this is a fun one you can include your kids in this craft I am painting each side of the blocks diagonally as you can see here I am starting with blue", "and then I am going to do green", "I decided to do orange and yellow and", "basically the way that you do this is that you paint all of them every side", "and then I am doing it diagonally", "and then you can create shapes when it is finished", "so I did not do this perfect because you know this is a toy for a three year old", "so I figured", "you know I did not need to spend hours and hours getting it perfect and also he helped me out with some of them", "so some of them are a little bit messier than others so that is why love experimenting with crafts like this because my son usually sits and watches while I do it and gets all excited", "and I gave him his own little paintbrush and a portion of the paper", "so that is why could mess around with the paint and also he helped me paint some of the blocks", "so some of the blocks have some like little pledges on it or whatever you call it", "but hey these do not need to be perfect because the whole point of this was to have fun be creative and make a little craft so that is why let these dry overnight", "and I kept he kept asking me if he could play with them all day", "and I told him that we should that they dried completely overnight", "and then he could play with them first thing in the morning", "so first thing in the morning", "when he woke up he did not even get out of his pajamas", "I did not brush his hair first thing he wanted to do", "was go and play with the blocks", "so once these finished drying completely we messed around with making different shapes and different patterns with them and then he played with them and stacked them up and knocked them over and had a good time with them so that is why can do these black and white", "you can do them color", "but you want to paint each side a different color", "and then you can create a fun little pattern with them like these", "so this next one is fun", "this is a DIY storm cloud light", "it is pretty easy to make I am starting with three white lanterns you can buy these in sets of three at either Target or Michaels", "they are affordable not very expensive at all I am taking my hot glue gun", "and I am just going to hot glue gun some batting all the way around them", "you do not have to be perfect with this because clouds are not perfect so", "at first I was like oh my word", "I am being so sloppy", "this is not going to look good", "but then in the end it looked perfect so that is why am going to go ahead and do that that takes a little bit of time", "but I am going to hot glue gun all the way around each of the white lanterns", "next you are going to want a wooden dowel about three and a half to four feet long", "and then some fishing line we happen to have a lot of fishing line around here because my husband likes to fish so that is why am just looping the fishing line through the metal part of the lantern and bringing it up", "and then I am going to go ahead and", "triple knot it", "now I made sure to measure the fishing line so that when I do hang it all of the lanterns hang evenly", "so that is why hung those all on and checked it out looking pretty good", "so next I have to feed the light through the bottom I got these blue LED lights online and basically I am going to put them inside of the lantern and have a few little strands coming out so that it looks like it is raining now if you have younger children and you are concerned that it might be a choking hazard which is definitely something to consider and think about you can go ahead and put the lights completely inside the lanterns and not have any rain coming out", "but that is totally up to", "you also depending on how high you hang it", "if you are concerned that your child might be able to reach it those are a few things to keep in mind", "but this is how it turned out you can either hang it on a few different hooks for me", "I hung it above the window", "I had some space where I could hang it very very easily", "and I like to be pretty present", "when my son is playing around this he was not able to touch it or reach it", "but I definitely wanted to", "I was around when he was playing with this", "it is fun", "and it looks really cool", "and it definitely looks really cool in the day",

today I am doing another DIY pampering video", "I know I do my fair share of these", "but I do think it is important to take that time for yourself whether it is once a week or once a month whenever you can make time for it compile a few things and just enjoy yourself and relax so today we are making some DIYs starting with a DIY soy candle", "so the way that I am making this is I am going to start by weighing the amount of water that the candle container can hold in this case I am using a mason jar I am going to reduce that weight by 20 and", "that is the weight of wax that you need to make a candle I am going to reset my scale and add the wax and way that I have a double boiler here with a thermometer", "and basically if you are interested in making candles you can invest in these types of things they are available at either Michaels or you can find them online", "but I am basically going to melt the wax over the double boiler checking the candy thermometer", "often I am going to slowly bring the wax up to 150 degrees", "Fahrenheit", "it is melted and once it is melted I am going to add fragrance right before I pour it into the mason jar", "so I am adding about one ounce of fragrance oil per pound of wax", "and I am adding jasmine and honeysuckle now", "the next thing you want to consider is that you want to warm your candle container using hot water or the lowest setting of your oven", "but I used the hot water here and", "this is going to that the glass does not crack when you pour the hot wax into it", "you can find wick supplies and wick holders at places like Michaels and online I found a mason jar they already have the wick in there", "I am carefully pouring the so a wax mixture into the mason jar and I am going to let that cure for one to two weeks for a maximum scent", "and then you are going to have a candle that is ready to go next", "I am making a DIY rose salt soak for the bath", "I am starting with some pink Himalayan salt and", "I am also going to add some epsom salts which are great for relaxing the muscles when you take a bath", "I am also adding some baking soda", "I will have the exact measurements in the description box below I find these dried roses and dried herbs in general like eucalyptus and things like that at a local herb store", "but you can also buy them in bulk online or find them online also for this bath soap I would recommend using some rose essential oil", "I am currently pregnant and I am not supposed to be soaking in rose oil at the moment", "but if you are not pregnant I highly recommend it", "it makes the bath smell absolutely amazing", "and it is the perfect relaxing soap next we are making some good mood room spray which you can spray in any room really", "but it is nice to spray in a room before you take a bath so that is why am filling it up with mostly water and then a little tiny bit of rubbing alcohol just that little is tiny bit to preserve it", "and then I am adding a few oils oils that I am allowed to use", "right now I am adding a few drops of lavender chamomile and vanilla", "this is a really nice relaxing and warm scent that again you can spray in any room", "but it is really nice when you are getting ready to take a bath soak and relax finally I am going to make some DIY green tea gel eye patches gel eye patches are everywhere right now", "but they are pretty easy to make and you can make them at home", "so that is why have some hot water", "I am adding two bags of green tea so that is why am basically going to be making some hot tea and then in this case I am adding some gelatin I am going to add 1 2 chew gelatin packets in this case", "I started with 1 packet and the gel patches", "were not firm enough", "so I had to add two now", "if you do not like to use gelatin you can use agar agar but keep in mind you are going to have to order that online because I have a hard time finding agar agar in any stores but that is a vegan option if you do not want to use gelatin", "so that is why am using 2 packets of gelatin", "I am going to mix it slowly", "you want to", "you add the gelatin very slowly otherwise it will kind of harden up fast", "so that is why am going to mix that in slowly adding two packets and then I am going to pour that onto a baking sheet very gently because it will spread everywhere", "and I am going to put that in the refrigerator", "and you want to refrigerate that overnight so that it hardens after it is had a chance to firm overnight", "I am going to pull it out", "I made some cutouts for under my eyes and", "I am going to cut those shapes and then gently pull them out and", "the green tea is great it has caffeine", "so it is going to wake up underneath your eyes and", "the cooling effect of the gelatin is going to help with puffiness dark circles and just tired eyes in general", "so that is why want to be really careful", "so these do not break and", "if you use enough gelatin they should be pretty firm so that is why am going to gently pull these up", "and you will have those little jelly under eye masks that will save you some pennies because those under eye masks can add up and become very expensive so that is why am going to place those underneath my eyes", "and you can relax either while you are in the bathtub soaking or while you are laying down in bed and that completes this video hopefully you guys enjoyed it", "and it gave you some ideas", "if you like my videos please be sure to subscribe to my channel", "check out my last two videos", "and I will see you guys in the next one bye you"],

different insurance than I did last time", "and I have", "not I am with Kaiser now", "and I had a doctor actually the doctor that delivered me", "I had him might with my last pregnancy", "but we have

get ahold of my ob gyn", "I could not get ahold of anybody except for like the online advice nurse or not the online advice nurse", "but when you call in there is like an advisors they told me you need to come into the ER", "so that is why went into the ER on Christmas Eve", "and I was there until Christmas morning", "and I got to say like I was not particularly happy with the the care I got because I do think spotting is common in pregnancy", "I do", "not I do not think it is something to not worry about it all", "but", "I also do not think it is something to kind of like get overly worried about", "and they kind of made me feel like you are having a miscarriage like", "and that was on Christmas Eve and Christmas morning", "that was kind of difficult", "and I was kind of preparing myself for the possibility of miscarrying", "and we did a little ultrasound and", "the baby was still alive and that gave me a lot of peace of mind", "but then the doctor was kind of like",

really happy with the overall process and so that is why went back you know multiple times over the next few days to just check on the baby to", "everything was okay", "and everything was okay", "and then the spotting subsided", "and I actually have been very lucky this time that I started feeling the baby much earlier than I did in my first pregnancy", "I did not feel oliver start kicking until around 14", "I think it was between 14 and 16 weeks", "I started feeling this baby at around 11 and a half weeks", "and I remember even kind of wondering is this actually the baby or am I crazy", "and I asked my doctor one of the doctors I saw because I actually saw a few different doctors she was like", "you probably are feeling the baby like it when you have your second", "sometimes you feel it a lot earlier", "so that brought me a lot of peace as well that I could feel and", "the ultrasound was saying that the baby was okay", "and so um you know in that sense this pregnancy has also been", "I guess a little bit more difficult than my other pregnancy because they kind of put me on a mile bedrest around Christmastime", "and I could not do much", "I am like", "oh it sounded like losing my breath", "I could not", "I", "now I ca not exercise", "I was exercising", "and I did not really exercise in my last pregnancy", "but I have been exercising", "but I have kind of taken a break since

was like", "oh I am gonna take it down", "um", "but I had said cuz it was like a year and a half ago where I told bar", "and I was", "like I am kind of afraid to be pregnant again because I am afraid

great today", "is of that right", "so we decided to wait to not prevent to it in October", "and I kept saying like okay", "well there is a chain", "yes I could be pregnant but", "probably not because

pregnant right away", "I was kind of like", "oh no", "and it took a few months and", "with this time we were kind of like", "oh let is have fun and", "like we did", "and then we ended up pregnant",

people came over and like their kids had colds and", "I am like", "do not touch my baby", "this was like a first time long", "you know my baby had come from the hospital because of the whole jaundice thing", "so I was like paranoid that was the winter time when everybody was sick and", "you like could not escape people having colds and things like that so that is why am hoping that in July having a newborn that everybody will be healthy", "and I wo not even have to worry about that so um it is scary when you have a newborn", "and you it is like a whole new thing", "so that is why am excited to go through it again", "I will be happy with a boy or a girl um very excited to have Oliver have a sibling he definitely is going", "he is gonna love it", "so that is the big news I am pregnant and excited", "sorry", "I have been m i a", "I am gonna try to be better like I said I am coming into my second trimester", "and I felt much better in my second trimester in my last pregnancy", "so that

could work any time of the year hypothetically", "but this is also a great idea for last minute holiday gifts for family or friends or coworkers and", "so that is why are going to be making some gift baskets today a few different ones we have a homemade gift box where we are making some cookies these are delicious", "and we also have a few different types of gift baskets", "so let is jump right in the first basket I am gonna make is like a girls night in pamper girl a basket so that is why just got a basket from Target", "you can also get this filler from Target for a dollar or", "so that is why am gonna put that in there", "and then I am gonna fill the basket up with a few things I got these convertible gloves from Target and a matching hat", "I love those because you can turn them into mittens but there are also fingerless gloves so that is why got that I am going to put that in there", "and then I am going to put a few fun items in there like face masks and sheet masks and candy and a few things so that when you give this to someone they can have a pampering night", "I also put some exfoliating gloves in there", "I talked about those a lot in my videos and I love those some Twizzlers or whatever their favourite candy is so if you know what their favorite candy is you can put a classic movie", "I put a Christmas movie in there", "but you can put any type of movie that will last all year long some hand in foot cream and", "then some skin care products", "so that is why collected a few products that I think this person would like", "and I put a chocolate in there some cleansing balm and a few products from fresh few masks and different things like that", "so that is why like this basket because again you can do this during the holidays", "but you can do this for birthdays or", "you can do this as gift baskets and you can go as crazy as you want with it", "and it is kind of like a fun pamper girls night in basket", "so you can wrap these in saran wrap and add a bow or you can put them under the tree as is or give them as is the next basket", "is also very similar in the sense that with all of these baskets it is kind of about pampering the person that you are giving it to", "but I would say this is maybe for a co worker or someone in your professional life that you know that if this is appropriate for them", "but I am adding some chocolate peanut butter pretzels a bottle of wine a candle a planner and some planner accessories so depending on if this is a male or female you can kind of adjust what you add in here", "and then I am going to add some chocolate and some tea as well", "so this is kind of like a more chill relaxed night in another thing I was thinking that would be great to add in here", "is some bath salts you can even make some bath salts", "I have a few recipes on my channel or you can buy some bath salts and put that in there so another kind of relaxing night in type 1 but a little bit different than the last one I found he is like kind of interesting decor pieces so that is why am putting that on the basket and again you can wrap it in saran wrap and put a bow around it and customize it however you want", "but this is another idea for a gift basket for either co workers or friends or whoever you think that this would be appropriate for during this time of year", "I have seen people be very giving in ways that you would not necessarily think like putting a basket out with water and treats for your UPS guy or the people who deliver to your house what I wanted to make is a little basket to keep in my car for if I see someone who is homeless or someone in need this is for a female I put some tampons in there some toothpaste", "some face wipes some mints things that I think we forget that we have", "that make us feel human and sometimes people do not have around this time of the year", "I have a toothbrush", "and I happen to have this confidence in a cream", "and I thought why not I will put a face cream in there", "maybe they will appreciate a face cream if you want you can put money in there or a gift card to a grocery store", "and I think if you see someone who needs that it is a nice way to be giving around the holidays in a way that you would not necessarily think right off the bat someone actually shared this idea with me", "and I loved it", "and", "so next I am making some homemade boxes I used to do this a lot when I was younger when I liked to give gifts to a bunch of different people", "but I did not necessarily have the budget or know what to give to a bunch of different people", "so that is why get white cake boxes at Michaels", "they are pretty inexpensive", "and then I take wrapping paper", "and I wrap the boxes up and make them look fun so that is why took some of the wrapping paper I am using this year that I got from Target", "and I just made sure it fit the top of the box", "and I am using double sided tape to tape it on there", "and then I am going to fill these boxes with homemade goodies and you can kind of do", "whatever you want to do you can make whatever you want to make", "but I am making some peanut brittle", "and I am going to make some vegan chocolate chip cookies so starting with the peanut", "brittle", "I actually cut this recipe in half", "but I am starting with corn syrup so that is why am going to add the corn syrup", "and I am also going to add some sugar I am going to give that a good stir", "and then I am going to add some dry roasted peanuts now", "all the exact measurements will be in the description below once I add the dry roasted peanuts I am going to stir that around add a little bit of sugar left in the measuring cup", "and then I am going to stir that really good", "and then I am going to let that cook over medium heat now the recipe that I had said to let it cook until it is 295 degrees which you can tell the temperature if you have a candy thermometer which my husband has a digital one I was starting to notice that the peanuts we are starting to get a little too dark so that is why took it off at 289", "I added the baking soda and that really causes it to fluff up", "and you can see it has a reaction there", "it gets really creamy", "and then I I had a little bit of butter on the baking sheet", "but I spread that on a baking sheet and you want to flatten it out so", "like I said you want to keep an eye on it because my peanuts got a little bit darker than my preference", "but it is still tasted good", "so that is why want to let that dry", "it is going to take a it is going to harden", "and then that is going to take about an hour or so", "and then you can break it up and you can put it in some saran wrap and put a bow around it and put it in your box and give it as a gift peanut", "brittle is pretty popular and a lot of people like it", "but you always want to", "in case you are giving this to somebody who has allergies to know or ask before you give it to them if they have any allergies or let them know what is in there next", "we are making some totally delicious vegan chocolate chip cookies I am preheating the oven to 350 degrees I am starting with a flax egg which is basically 1 tablespoon of ground flax seed meal with some water", "you mix that together and stick it in the refrigerator and this acts as a replacement for an egg in a recipe I mentioned this before in a previous video but the person who films my video Shane", "he is a vegan", "so a lot of times he helps find vegan recipes for me to try out on my channel and this one was extra delicious", "I am adding some palm shortening obviously", "this is also vegan", "and then I am going to add some coconut palm sugar", "I added a little bit of vanilla extract and OH some maple syrup", "and then I am going to give this a good mix", "and then it is time to add my flax egg which hopefully has been in the refrigerator at this point for about 30 minutes", "or so that is why am going to mix this together really good as you can see that has gelatinize um and again that replaces an egg", "now you can certainly make regular chocolate chip cookies", "but I gotta say these were really mind blowing ly delicious", "I ate every single last one that I did not give away", "and I was pretty obsessed with them", "and I did feel a little bit more healthy eating this because it had flax seeds in it", "and I used almond flour and coconut flour instead so as you can see here", "I am adding the almond flour", "and then I am gonna add the coconut flour which the coconut flour gives it the most amazing taste", "and I gotta say these cookies look a little bit different", "but I think a lot of people would not be able to tell that they are vegan because they just taste so darn good", "so even if you are not vegan give these a try because they are so delicious or you can make these for someone who is vegan I am NOT vegan", "but I am always down to try out these recipes so that Shane can try them out and also so that a lot of you guys who are vegan on my channel can try them out", "and I have also lots of friends who are vegan as well", "so plus", "they were so good I am definitely gonna make them again", "I am adding some vegan chocolate chips and I am gonna mix this real good", "and then I am gonna put this on a baking sheet", "I have already preheated the oven to 350 degrees so that is why am going to bake these for 15 to 20 minutes just keep an eye on them", "and like I said they do look a little bit different than a traditional chocolate chip cookie", "but they are absolutely delicious and", "these are actually a nice idea to put out for Christmas Eve for Santa", "maybe Santa is a vegan who knows", "maybe Santa wants a little bit of a healthier chocolate chip cookie maybe he will love these", "once these are done I am going to let them cool", "and then I have some cellophane here", "I think I said saran wrap earlier when I was talking about the peanut", "brittle", "but I meant cellophane", "and I am going to", "wrap these up put a pretty little bow and put these in the basket", "now you can do peanut brittle", "you can do cookies you", "there is so many different types of cookies you can do and you can totally customize this again however you want for whoever you are giving this to", "but I put these in there", "and then you can put a little note in there or a gift card or whatever you want", "and then I am gonna put a little bow on this box", "and then you can put that under the tree and let people know that there is you know

multiple people for a dollar and the weight of the bail kind of holds it down", "now there is a few different ways to do this", "you know you can do a napkin ring", "but I thought that this looked nice", "it is basically a simple wrap so that it is easy for people to take off", "but it is a nice addition to a holiday table", "and I have these plain white napkins", "so that is why thought it added a nice pop to them", "and like I said again you can make these a few different ways", "but this ended up turning out pretty simple and easy and easy to remove", "so your guests do not have to like pull it off the napkin or worry about it", "this is pretty easy and also you can customize it with different colored ribbon", "they had a few different colors at the dollar store and again you can have fun with it but creating easy napkin rings affordable", "adds a nice touch to your dinner table one thing I love to get at the dollar store is a vase", "and I decided to pick up three of them", "I saw purple ones there this time", "so that is why was going to spray paint them gold regardless", "but I actually kind of liked how it looked after i spray painted it", "I had like an undertone of purple coming through", "like you could barely tell but it made it I just made it look pretty if you have a vase or two or three that you feel comfortable spray painting you can certainly do that", "but you can also pick them up for a dollar a piece or you can use a wine bottle", "and you can spray it with gold spray paint another cute idea which I did not do here", "was you can take a stencil and have letters like Jo why joy spray paint those gold", "and you can hot glue gun those on", "but I decided to keep them pretty simple", "and I guess plain if you will", "and then I got these really great trees", "they are like these small mini Christmas trees I got from Target", "they were in the dollar section", "but I got them they were actually in the three dollar section", "so that is why have a dollar section in a three dollar section", "so I got those I will put a runner down and a few candles to kind of add a little bit more to this", "but I did like how the little ring holders and how everything looked together at all paired nicely with the gold and again like I say always on my channel like my style is maybe not for everyone but the cool thing", "is that you can find these things for a dollar", "and you can customize it and make it your own unique table scape and that is what I like about this", "so hopefully it gives you a little bit of inspiration", "but I liked how it turned out", "I thought it was really pretty and simple and chic and best", "part is super affordable to create all of the napkin holders were under a dollar and then 3 a dollar each for each vase", "so I really liked this", "I took some flowers from around my house and created like a little mini table scape so another idea this is a little bit more whimsical for putting your silverware on the table on top of the plates", "is you can find these great little mini stockings at the dollar store", "obviously you might want to wash them because they are kind of left out they are not like in a bag or anything so just because you are going to be putting silverware in there", "you can wash them", "and then you can stick the silverware in there", "and", "I also think this is really cute and whimsical maybe for like a Christmas Eve or Christmas or any type of dinner that you might be doing around the holidays like I think this looks really cute and again so easy", "you can get I think it came with about six for a dollar so if you are going to be doing a really large table you might have to spend two dollars", "but I loved how cute these were", "and they also work as another option for the table and kind of where to put the silverware", "so this last idea was not an original one I saw a bunch of these on Pinterest and they have these kind of plastic snowflakes of all different shapes and sizes", "so that is why bought a few packets of those and a big snowflake", "and basically I saw that a bunch of people kind of made wreaths and door pieces and there is a few different ways that people did it so basically I kind of arranged them the way that I wanted to", "I stacked a few of the snowflakes on top of each other and kind of had fun with it at first", "I was like", "is this gonna look cheesy", "I was a little worried at first but a hot glue gun them and created like a little door piece and just had fun with it and went a little crazy because why not it is from the dollar store", "and I I ended up really liking how it turned out", "and I used it on my door for until I made a wreath which I have a wreath video coming out soon", "so my wreath is out on the door now", "but in the meantime this one was there before that", "and then I think I might bring it back out again too into the winter because it ended up looking really pretty against the door", "so this is", "kind of like a DIY door hang that you can use and you can also be creative with it and do a wreath or you know whatever you think might be fun with snowflakes", "I also think those snowflakes would be great for hanging on the tree", "so there is a few different things you can do with them and", "you can get each of the packets for a dollar piece", "so hopefully this gave you some ideas for decorating for the holiday", "keep your eyes peeled for some more holiday videos coming soon check out my last two videos and subscribe to my channel if you like my channel", "and I

that is why am going to share a few things that I like to do with you guys I am going to start first with a DIY though this is going to be a dry scalp treatment it is very easy to make all you need is half of a ripe banana some honey and some olive oil", "so I am going to smash up the banana", "then I am going to add about a heaping spoonful of honey", "and then I am going to add a little bit of olive oil so that is why have my olive oil and a little squeeze bottle", "so I am going to squeeze a little bit in there", "but I would say about a teaspoon of olive oil and", "I am going to mix that together", "really well if you do not like the clumps which I prefer it without the clumps I stick it in my blender and blend it up quick now you can take the mixture and massage it into your scalp", "leave it on for 10 to 15 minutes before you shampoo", "and then you can save the rest by wrapping it up and putting it in the refrigerator", "you can do this treatment twice or three times a week until you run out", "so that is why am going to do that before I shampoo and leave that in my hair and the next I am going to be making a DIY hot oil treatment", "this is also very easy to make and something you can use before you shampoo for extra hydration", "so it is really easy all", "I am gonna be doing", "is three tablespoons of coconut oil I have jojoba oil and avocado oil", "i melted the coconut oil in the microwave for about 10 seconds", "and I am going to add about half of a teaspoon of each of the oils into the coconut oil I am going to also add a little tiny bit of olive oil", "I have some fresh rosemary from my garden you can add a few drops of essential oil for scent like rosemary or another one of your choice", "but I have some fresh rosemary", "so that is why am going to", "put the leaves in there", "and I am going to let that marinate for an hour or so", "and I am going to come back", "I am going to remove the rosemary with a mesh strainer", "and then you can heat this up for about 10 to 15 seconds in the microwave for a hot oil treatment", "usually the coconut oil will solidify in colder temperatures so that is why will have to microwave it", "but it is not absolutely necessary if you do not want to", "and then you can take a little bit of the warm oil and apply it to your hair", "I like to do it from the middle of my hair down focusing on my ends", "so that is why like to leave this in my hair with the scalp treatment also on the top of my head for about 10 to 15 minutes", "but you can leave it on up to one or two or 3 hours and watch a movie or a show and for today I am just gonna put my hair up in a ponytail I am gonna do a few other treatments before I jump in the shower", "I am gonna start by washing my face with my vitamin C cleanser", "I like this line derma doctor", "I have a few things from them", "and I am going to cleanse my skin", "and then I am gonna exfoliate what you want to you", "do exfoliate in the winter months", "I mean you can exfoliate all year long", "but sometimes you have that kind of dry dull skin in the winter months", "and it is extra important to exfoliate with a physical exfoliant like this one from fresh",

case", "you have not seen that video and I am going to exfoliate my skin", "I like to go down my neck in my chest as well", "and then I am going to put on a deep hydrating mask", "this is a hydrating mud mask from Shea Moisture", "I found this at Target", "but you can find it at most drugstores and", "I am going to take a brush", "and I am gonna brush this all on my face down my neck on my chest on my arms and let that sit and dry before I jump in the shower and wash it off", "I normally apply it that much all over my body if I know I am gonna be in the shower right away after because then you can wash it off pretty easily", "and then I am gonna shampoo my hair", "I recently got this Ecco Bella moisturizing shampoo", "it smells like vanilla I have been using the body moisturizer for years you can find this at Whole Foods that is a great line in general", "I like a bunch of things from Ecco Bella", "but you have", "the vanilla shampoo and conditioner and Body Lotion smells divine", "and then I am gonna use the Shea Moisture deep treatment masque", "and I am gonna focus on my ends obviously since I use the pre shampoo oil treatment my hair is definitely already moisturized", "so that is why am just gonna focus on my ends with this treatment", "but you can certainly kind of amp up your treatments during the winter time and use a moisturizing mask", "and then I am gonna use this loofah", "I usually will either use exfoliating gloves or one of my DIY exfoliators I have done a variety of them on my channel", "but I also really like these little loofas", "and you can put your body wash on there", "and exfoliate your body", "and then when I exit the shower I am using my pixie Rose oil blend", "I love this", "I have tried more expensive rose oils and this one is definitely as good", "and it is not does not make me break out", "it smells amazing", "and it is really hydrating", "so I have been using this at night actually after I wash my face", "I use that then I am using some coconut oil all over my body again", "I have done a variety of DIY Dreiser is and all sorts of different things on my channel", "but right now I am just going to do coconut

decorating it", "I am gonna be sharing with you guys a few hacks", "so that is why am gonna jump right in the first one I want to share with", "you guys is picking up the freshest tree possible and what I like to do is I run my hand along the branch to see if any bristles come off a fresh tree", "will remain intact that is a good way to see if your tree is fresh right off the bat the fresh tree there is a few different options to choose when it comes to trees and it is really personal preference we have gone for noble fir a lot", "but this year we went for Fraser Fir which can last up to eight weeks", "it is pretty common for most Christmas tree lots to do this", "but you want to that you always get a fresh cut on the bottom of your tree to allow for maximum water absorption once you get home", "so one thing I started doing was wrapping my Christmas tree and tarp before I brought it through the house because I noticed last year", "I had bristles from the tree all over", "and I was sweeping after I was done decorating", "so this is a great tip once the tree is up", "I am gonna add the tree skirt", "and then I am going to water the tree with a gallon of water", "right away it is gonna be pretty thirsty", "so you want to you water it right away and also water every single day", "and then I am gonna start decorating what I like to use is a nine outlet cord you can find these on Amazon", "these are great because you can plug it in it", "has a switch and on and off switch", "and then it has plenty of plugins for all of your lights and", "so that is why am basically putting this down the center of the tree", "I am going to use a green flexible tie to tie this around the middle of the tree so that works great for securing the cord", "and then I am gonna just start decorating I have my box of holiday decor", "I actually did a video a while back on how I organized all of my holiday decor", "but I like to use white lights that is totally preference", "my mom used to use colored lights growing up the way I like to put lights on the tree as I start from the outside of the branch", "and I go layer by layer so that is why can use the multiple outlet extension cord to run along the base of the tree for multiple outlets so basically if you have multiple lights", "and it is a bigger tree that is a great option", "so that is why am just going to layer those white lights", "and then I am gonna start decorating", "I actually have ornaments that are not glass", "they look really similar to glass", "they look pretty good", "but they are plastic because I like to have my son help me", "and I have actually had him for several years", "and they do not break which is great so that is why am gonna start decorating the tree with those", "and they know", "yes what you got to put it a little bit more inward like this", "so that finishes up this quick tip video", "please keep a lookout for all my holiday videos coming up this month", "if you like my channel

guest prep so that is why know that the holidays sometimes can be crazy and stressful", "but if you have ever shown up to stay at someone is house and they have gone out of their way to make it special when you come it is always memorable and appreciated", "and it takes a tiny bit of planning", "but in the end I feel people really appreciate the hospitality so in today is video I am going to show you guys some of my tips for going above and beyond and giving your guests a wonderful experience at your home this holiday season", "so hopefully you enjoyed this video and", "I am going to jump right in", "so that is why am going to start in the guest room", "my husband", "and I have been married almost 10 years now and for seven of the 10 years we lived in apartments", "so that is why actually did not have a guest room and", "people would come and we d have like blowup mattresses and things like that", "so that is why would wing it", "and I always dreamed of having a guest room to prepare for visitors because I genuinely enjoy the staging part of it and getting it ready before they come and obviously you always think of tidying up first and just getting it clean but above and beyond that", "I like to make the room feel extra special for the holidays by dressing up the bedding adding colorful blankets and pillows and it is a quick and easy way to make it look festive now", "I do not always get a chance to do this when guests come just depending on how much notice I am given before they come", "but it is a nice touch to create a guest basket", "so that is why can add water and a few yummy snacks and that is a great place to start", "and then you can customize this with whatever else you want to add", "so that is why can hit up the dollar store so it is not breaking the bank or grab some items from the Travel section at Target", "usually they are all under three dollars and I put a few items", "I think my guests might appreciate", "and if I know that they have to do laundry", "I will also add a few laundry items as well", "I think it is a nice added touch someone did this for me once in my lifetime", "and I remembered it", "I mean I have remembered it my whole life", "and I have always wanted to do it as often as I can when guests comment I", "I feel like it makes them feel more at home", "like they do not have to ask where things are and", "it is like their own little kit", "also another great tip is to add a little card with the Wi Fi passcode", "or I am just putting a cute tag on the side of the basket with the Wi Fi passcode so that they do not have to ask and if they get logged out they can always log back in so you can go as crazy as you want with this or as minimal you can put water and a snack if I know someone is going to be staying for a while", "I will do kind of a bigger basket", "I do find that when people have been traveling for a long time for several hours they generally are tired they just want to take a shower and relax so I am putting a few clean towels on the bed", "I have a hand towel and a few body towels as well I am going to just put that right next to the basket if they are staying more than a few days I like to add a hamper to the guest room so that they have somewhere to put their worn items and", "I also like to leave out an extra phone charger for their iPhones or iPads", "and I took my dollar store DIY tray added some flowers some lemon water and the remote controls on it", "I wrote a little letter thanking the guests for coming and also wrote out instructions on how to work the remote controls you can do this in the living room as well or wherever you have a TV with remote controls that you think that they might not be able to use this is a great tip for babysitter is as well because most of the time when people come to stay at your house their house sitting there babysitting", "or there is their guests", "they do not know how to use the remote control so it is helpful to do this so a quick thank you note and instructions on how to use the remote controls and that pretty much finishes up the guest room like I said I do not always get a chance to do the basket sometimes I always pretty much leave out flowers and water and things like that", "but you can go depending on how much time you have you can go as crazy as you want make your guests feel extra extra special", "so now I am moving on to the guest bathroom even when we did live in apartments", "and we did not have a guest bedroom I started putting a basket of toiletries out and", "every time we would have someone stay with us they would always use up everything I put in the basket so it kind of became a habit of mine to refill it constantly", "so that is why do keep a basket in the guest bathroom stocked at all times and even if it is just someone who is coming for a day or they are there for a few hours I find that people like to rummage through there and use some of the things if I know I am having someone for a longer period of time", "I add a bunch more things", "so I kind of rummage through the Travel section at Target or", "you can go to the dollar store", "but I put travel toothpaste travel toothbrushes hand cream shade cream razors shampoo and conditioner soap", "face wipes", "just whatever things that they will need for the bathroom and so that is why keep that in there pretty much at all times I try to keep it stocked also with like ear swabs and different things", "so that is why always have that", "and then I do put flowers and a candle in the bathroom", "as well I pretty much have that no matter what if I mean not on every single day because sometimes my son is in there", "and it is not", "it is kind of a mess", "but if I know someone is gonna be coming and staying with us", "I do try to clean it up a little bit and tidy it", "and then I do like to hang some robes so they have comfy robes and that is pretty much everything that I do in the bathroom now for the living room", "you can add you know comfy throw blankets and that is always nice to have around most people love their morning cup of coffee", "so a nice added touch is to create a little area on your kitchen counter or a side table for a coffee bar so you can stock up on coffee you can set out sugar and mugs and spoons and basically create a little self serve coffee bar so your guests can help themselves to anything they d like without having to wake you up in the morning or worry about rummaging around through the kitchen they can kind of help themselves to some hot cocoa or a late night tea or an early morning coffee", "everything is right there for them", "so that is why feel comfortable", "and I definitely find you know we have had more and more people stay with us since we moved into this house", "and I do find that this is something that they go over too", "and they help themselves", "so the point of all of this obviously is to make your guests feel appreciated", "and you know you want to read your guests you might have someone who would think this is excessive", "and it would make them feel uncomfortable so it is really kind of about knowing your audience and knowing who is coming and if they would appreciate these types of things and", "it is also about adding your own personal touch of hospitality when your guests come so it does not seem unnatural or fake", "so maybe if you implement one or two of these ideas and you kind of add your own personal touch your own unique ideas to make your guests feel extra special when they come to visit", "and I do think the extra planning and attention to detail will stay with them for a long time and be appreciated so that is why hope you enjoyed this video", "and it did give you some tips to try out for

keep these activated charcoal pills around because they are actually good to have for food poisoning they absorb toxins in the body so you can take it internally but in this case I am mixing the two together adding a little bit of water", "and it makes a great face mask", "and it is a detoxifying face mask", "so that is why am going to apply a thin layer onto my skin", "let that sit for about 10 to 15 minutes it is going to harden and tighten", "and then I am going to remove it with a warm wet towel", "so basically this is a great mask if you suffer from breakouts because it is detoxifying it is going to pull the extra oils and dirt and grime out from your pores and it is a great mask", "so I definitely recommend it next", "I am making a caffeinated under eye mask super easy and great for tired puffy eyes so that is why am using some ground up coffee grounds and some honey equal parts mixing them together", "and then you can apply that under your eye leave it on for 10 to 15 minutes the caffeine is going to wake up those puffy eyes and energize and rejuvenate underneath your eyes", "I would recommend keeping this eye mask in the refrigerator the cooling effect will help reduce puffy eyes and you can perform this morning or night just apply a thin layer underneath your eyes leave it on for 10 to 15 minutes and remove with a damp cloth", "finally we are making a do it yourself lash brow conditioning serum", "so this is three simple ingredients I am starting with aloe vera I am taking about equal parts aloe vera castor oil and vitamin E and adding them together in a small bowl you can also put this mixture in a mascara wand container you can find those on Amazon", "I did not get one of those", "but I keep this in the refrigerator", "it creates a serum you can just use those mascara wands to apply it onto your brows and your lashes", "and you can do this every night for a conditioning and growth effect on your eyelashes and eyebrows so hopefully you guys

"_3WKx-sacCY": ["hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I am making some more super easy decor except everything for today is video is from the dollar store most of it is from the Dollar Tree", "almost all of it is from the Dollar Tree actually just kind of rediscovered the Dollar Tree", "and they have so many great things for the holidays and so many fun things you could do around the house", "I saw so many ideas", "but I wanted to try so let is start with the first one which is a DIY Stone trivet total", "is 2 to make this so this is basically something you can put your teapot on or your pots on", "so that is why have these traditional kind of like cork trivet that you can find at the Dollar Tree they are a little hard to find there if you ca not find them there", "world market carries them for a dollar 25 a piece they come in a pack of three for about 375 so that is why are a little over a dollar", "but if you ca not find them at the dollar store you can find them at world market", "and then I got", "one pack of actually got two packs of stones", "but I ended up using one I try to find the smoothest and glue gunned them on the trivet", "now the thing is", "is you want to kind of find the matching pieces before you get started gluing so", "almost mimic like how it is going to look", "so lay them all out find the pieces that will fit and then go ahead and take your hot glue gun and glue them down now", "I almost put a kind of rope around the edge to block off the cork", "but I felt like that was a little bit of a hazard", "so that is why did not do that", "but um I mean you do not get all the rocks to fit perfectly", "you could put little smaller rocks in the holes that are open but overall you want to make sure it is as smooth as possible so your pot and your or your tea pot will fit directly on this", "so that is why am going to go ahead and glue everything down", "try to get as smooth as possible and that finishes a easy 2 trivet", "I think it is kind of fun", "it is definitely different", "you have a stone trivet as opposed to a traditional trivet you just want to", "you look for smooth rocks you can use it for pots and pans or your teapot next", "we are making DIY candle holders total cost 4", "so that is why can find these supplies at the dollar store", "obviously you have the bottoms and then you have the top", "and they had so many different options for the top you can make really long ones or larger ones you can make apothecary jars", "there is so many things you could do", "and I think I am going to do a bathroom version of dollar store DIYs but basically I am taking some glass glue", "this is the thing that was not from the dollar store I had it in my craft drawer", "so basically I am taking a little bit", "and I am gluing the top on to the bottom", "and you just want to", "it says even as possible from different angles it looked even and from other angles", "it did not so I had to sit there and look at it from from so many different angles because that is the thing with doing a DIY version of this", "is you want to", "it is even and centered", "so I glued the top down", "you want to wait for an hour", "and then they make nice candle holders for 2 bucks apiece", "and then I got these white rocks again from the dollar store they sell one packet of the rocks", "are a dollar so that is why guess technically this would be five dollars for this whole thing", "if you include the rocks but the rocks are optional and then I am going to put a tea light candles in there", "and these are great for you know little candle holders that you can put on your table or", "you can put around the house next", "is my personal favorite and also the easiest to make and this is the DIY coffee table tray", "this is a total of 2 1 for the frame", "so that is why got an extra large frame", "and then I have some burlap I actually had some already", "but you can also find burlap at the dollar store I doubled over on the burlap so that you could not see through it", "I cut it to match", "you can also put a placemat in there if you are not into kind of my style which I like the more neutral colors and things like that if you are not into that you can always paint you could do gold or white", "and then they have different placemats at the dollar store", "you can cut those and I saw a variety of different ones", "but I like burlap it kind of goes along with the theme of my neutral house", "and so that makes a simple tray and then the best way to dress this up is to have some flowers I obviously move these beautiful hydrangeas all around for this video because they are so pretty", "and they they look great", "and they look great on this little tray so you can hold coffee holders your coffee your remote control and some flowers and you have a beautiful coffee table tray", "finally we are making a DIY triangle frame which is a total cost of four dollars", "so that is why can get these frames for a dollar apiece", "and basically you can do an Instagram frame if you want", "so you can print out pictures from your Instagram or", "if you had a trip that you recently took or family pictures we just did the camping trip that we took", "and I decided to make a frame with those pictures so basically I am taking three different sets of pictures filling them into the frame I am taking off the back", "so you do not need the backs", "and then I am gluing them together with a hot glue gun to create a triangle it takes a few seconds for the glue to dry", "and then you are going to basically want to create a triangle", "and you can put it in a place where people can see all of the pictures or you can move it around and change which picture you can see in the front", "so I like this idea because you have three pictures in one basically and it makes a fun frame and you can customize it if you want it to be a certain event or you can do wedding pictures or", "whatever", "and you can also make these as centerpieces for weddings or events like baby showers or things like that which I saw this on Pinterest", "and I love that you could do it", "so that is why so that is why wanted to try it out", "and it is relatively easy to do", "you can also put a flameless candle inside and it will illuminate at night the pictures will illuminate and you can find these flameless candles at the dollar store it is about three for a dollar", "I could only find red they did not have white", "but you ca not see the candle anyway", "so I loved that idea so hopefully you guys enjoyed this DIY video if you like these types of dollar store DIY videos", "please let me know by thumbing up this video", "I definitely want to do more", "it makes it more affordable for me to try out these DIYs when they

"and I want to share with you guys I am going to share three with you today", "and then I am going to continue sharing a few more over this winter season as we progress them to these next few months when it gets colder so hopefully there will be a recipe that everyone can enjoy I am starting with the kale and quinoa soup which is my personal favorite", "I am adding a can of petite diced tomatoes and one can of rinsed great northern beans which you can find these at most grocery stores next I am adding two bay leaves which I will remove before we eat it and then some basil and one cup of uncooked quinoa that has been rinsed next", "I am adding vegetable stock", "and then I am going to add the kale which has been chopped and rinsed as well", "finally I am going to chop one half of an onion", "this is a white onion", "and then I am adding a little bit of rosemary and thyme as well and in this case I just added a little bit of water to cover the kale", "and then I am going to put the top of the crock pot on turn it on", "and you can set it to low for six hours or high for four hours", "and then you have a delicious quinoa kale soup", "this is my personal favorite", "my family is not crazy about this recipe", "but I am a huge fan of kale and quinoa", "and I love this recipe", "and I think it tastes amazing and its really nice for one of those cold days", "it is a yummy soup so that is why would highly recommend this if you enjoy those ingredients and", "so the next recipe is definitely a crowd pleaser especially on those cold winter days", "so that is why am starting with chopped broccoli", "chopped onion a little bit of oregano grated carrots and half of a container of reduced fat cream cheese I am adding a tiny bit of nutmeg", "and then I am going to add some vegetable stock", "so I am going to give this a good mix and cover it and cook it on high for two hours or low for four to six hours or until the broccoli is tender when the broccoli is finally tender and it is had a chance to cook I am going to ladle three quarters of the soup out and blend it", "pretty well you want to keep a little bit for texture and consistency", "but most of it you want to you blend once that is blended", "I am going to add it back to the crock pot and in a side Bowl I am going to do equal parts milk and flour", "now I am using almond milk in this case unflavored almond milk", "but you can use regular milk if you want this has a lot of dairy to begin with", "so that is why just decided to use almond milk and that is what I had I am mixing that together pouring that in that is going to act as a thickening agent so that is why am going to go ahead and stir that", "and then you can add as much cheese as you want at this point", "this is a broccoli cheese soup so if you are dairy free you can find a dairy free cheese", "but I did add some cheese here", "and I am going to go ahead and give that a good stir then you can label that into a bowl and top it with some fresh broccoli and cheese if you want as well and that makes a really delicious broccoli cheese soup that is great for a cold winter day next", "I am making some veggie chili I am starting with two different types of beans I have two cans of dark red kidney beans that have been rinsed and drained and one can of light red kidney beans you can also cook those fresh if you d like two cans of tomato sauce you also want to add some diced tomatoes in this case", "I have a large can of diced tomatoes or you can use two small cans", "and then I am going to use a small can of chopped green chilies and if you are lucky enough to be in Albuquerque you can do hatch chilies because those are amazing now", "this is totally optional but beer gives it a nice flavor and obviously the alcohol completely cooks off by time this is done", "but you can also omit that and add a little bit of extra vegetable stock I will put the exact measurements in the description below", "I also added a little bit of ground cumin and chili powder some chopped onion and I am adding two sun dried tomatoes and one chipotle pepper that was in adobo sauce", "so this is definitely a very tasty chili", "but if you are prone to heartburn maybe pass on this", "it is very good", "and it is vegetarian", "I would not call all of these recipes healthy but they are definitely Hardy and good for those cold winter days and

bye"], "YRH9F5cQcnM": ["hey guys welcome back to my channel", "so today is part 2 of my roadtrip and camping series there was a lot we did to prepare for these trips", "and I wanted to share with you guys some of the hacks and little tips and tricks that I tried before we went on this trip", "obviously I am NOT a camping pro", "but these are some of the things I found on various websites or Pinterest things that I thought would work well for our trip and", "I also wanted to show you guys", "so I mentioned this briefly in my last video", "I showed me putting this in my glove compartment in our car", "but I packed a little kind of first aid kit for the car I have these toe warmers and hand warmers which came in handy for sure", "if you wait till the end of this video there is a vlog and I will mention those or maybe actually let is see maybe I mentioned those in the vlog on our vlog Channel", "but I packed some bo9 and kids Dramamine some Tylenol one thing I forgot to mention here or show here rather is benadryl which we picked up on the way there in case there is any bug bites or any allergic reactions", "it is good to have that as well in my opinion", "another great tip that I found online that I thought would be useful is saving old containers or recycling them and using them for storage for long road trips or camping trips so that is why took like the coffee mate type containers", "and I stored our cereals like our oatmeal and Cheerios and things like that in those containers", "I also asked a friend for an old coke container and you can recycle one of those big soda containers you can use it to store items", "but I used it as a toilet paper holder and dispenser", "I thought this idea seemed a little interesting although you can take toilet paper and use that", "but the thing about camping is you have to pop a squat and go in the woods which was not that big of a deal to be completely honest", "but you need to have toilet paper and", "even Byron was like", "oh my gosh did we forget to all the paper", "and I am like no", "I have it covered", "I have made a little toilet paper dispenser before we left", "do not worry so", "anyway I actually put two toilet papers", "in here which technically you are supposed to put one", "but I figured in case we needed to I could open the container up and grab the second one", "so this is supposed to act as a dispenser", "it worked pretty well", "I would say that it is not completely necessary after using it for a while you can definitely lose the toilet paper inside", "but it is a pretty nice little hack if you do want a dispenser", "and you want you see acts s to your toilet paper without having to set it down in the woods or wherever I wanted to try making some DIY hand wipes and body wipes you can use these obviously on your hands or your body or to clean up the car or", "whatever you need to use it for basically a few cups of water and essential oil drops of your choice I am using tea tree oil lavender and lemon", "and then I am adding some natural body wash so", "about a tablespoon of this is like a seaweed body wash that I got at sprouts or Trader Joe", "is I ca not remember where I think I got it at sprouts", "and then I am mixing that in the water till it creates like a soapy frothy water", "and I am going to pour that in a container that fits a paper towel", "roll", "you might have to cut the paper towel roll if you want it to fit in certain containers but these worked out", "really well I use them a ton you pour the liquid into the container and then put the paper towel roll in there and shake it up so after shaking it up the paper towel roll will completely absorb the liquid leaving you with hand and body wipes just remove the middle part of the paper towel roll", "pull it up through", "and you will have the wipes ready to go", "and like I said these were great", "we use these a lot you can use these for cleaning yourself or items", "I also use this for cleaning out pots and pans sometimes that kind of dependent on however I wanted to use it", "but I used it for a lot of different purposes next", "we are going to make a more natural option for repelling bugs and this was a pretty good recipe I will admit it worked pretty well for repelling the bug", "so I wanted to share it with you guys", "these are bug repellent lotion bars I am making it a little bit differently", "I found this recipe on Pinterest", "but I am kind of adjusting it", "a little bit you have coconut oil beeswax shea butter and I am going to add a few essential oils now that trick here is to add the citronella essential oil", "so that is why had to buy that essential oil", "I did not have it", "and then I am adding a little bit of avocado oil", "and I think I added lemongrass as well in there", "and maybe a little bit of lavender", "as well I will put the exact measurements of the recipe below", "so I created a little double boiler here in a medium saucepan I have hot water boiling", "then I have a stainless steel bowl on top of that", "and I am melting all the ingredients together and stainless steel bowl so that is why am going to mix that together until it is melted completely", "then I am going to pour that mixture into lotion bar molds I have made a variation of lotion bars on my channel before you can adjust these if you do not want them to be a bug repellent do not use the citronella", "and then it will be a traditional lotion bar", "so this does smell a little bit like bug repellent because you have the citronella", "but I am pouring that into lotion bar molds or just traditional molds", "I have square molds here", "you can either let it dry in the refrigerator or out in the open", "it will take a little bit longer", "and then they will Harden and turn into lotion bars and", "you can put them in a ziploc bag now the thing with putting them in a ziplock bag", "is if you put them all together and it gets hot they will melt so keep that in mind you can keep them in your ice chest if you want to keep them cold or do one or two you probably wo not need any more than one or two to be honest on the camping", "I took them all", "but I did not need them all", "so anyway those are that and the next I am going to be making these really great on the go lunches so if you are going on a road trip or a camping trip or honestly even if you are looking for a healthier option for a lunch you can make these little salad in mason jars", "these are all over the internet", "so I am not the first person to come up with this idea but", "it is such a great idea I am making a quinoa salad in a mason jar", "so I am adding cooked quinoa to the bottom I have some zucchini chopped zucchini", "I have some chopped tomatoes and also some peppers", "Byron does not like peppers", "so that is why am not putting it in his I", "made three", "but my son is not a huge salad lover we tried to get him to eat it", "but he did not eat the whole thing there are not a ton of healthy options on a long road trip so it is nice to make these so that you have a healthy option if you want it", "these are great for also school or work lunches you want to consume it within 24 hours because the ingredients can go bad and a lot of the recipes online add the dressing directly inside the mason jar", "I did not love this idea because I felt like it would wilt a lot faster", "and so that is why can customize", "this make it however you like with ingredients you like obviously want to put the heaviest ingredients down first and the lightest on top", "but what I am going to do is instead of adding the dressing inside I am going to create little dressing cups you can buy these little salsa cups", "but I collect them whenever I am at a salsa bar", "I just take two extra or two or three extra", "and I am adding olive oil balsamic vinegar maple syrup lemon juice some dill a few spices I will put the exact ingredients below", "but I am making a dressing I am going to add that to the little salsa containers", "and I am going to put that on top of the salad you can have a little bit of a fresher salad when you come around to eating your salad", "and you can pour however much dressing", "you want so", "that is why am pouring the dressing into the three cups I am going to put the tops on", "and then I am going to put that directly on top of the salad and the way that I am going to keep that down", "is I am going to put a tape across like a little cross tape and that is going to keep the dressing on top of the salad until you are ready to consume it", "and then you have a on the go salad", "so that is why can put this in your ice chest and these are great again for road trip or for a camping trip or for just lunch for work", "I am also going to make this cup of noodle", "this is a little bit healthier version of cup of noodles and actually we ate noodles the first night we got there", "we boil some water and add it so that is why have a little cabbage", "I am adding cabbage carrots and I am also going to add some spinach", "and then you want to get the really really thin noodles", "the ones that will cook with boiling water", "so that is why add boiling water", "and then you let it cook for", "about I would say ten minutes at least so that it gets soft now to add a little bit more flavor", "I have a cube stock it is a vegetable stock cube", "and I am adding a quarter of a cube to each little container", "I have a little bit of ginger I am going to add some soy sauce and some lime", "so this turns your boiling water into a broth and leaves you with a really nice yummy soup", "so this is really nice all you need", "is boiling water and you can add it", "so it is a great lunch or dinner", "and it was cold the first night", "so it was nice to have kind of an instant soup and a little bit of a healthier version than some of the other instant soups available so that is why am taking my fork mixing it together", "and then I am also going to put that on top of the mason jar", "tape it down", "you can also pop these in your cooler and use the mason jars later for drinking water again this one lasts between 28 to 48 hours depending on how fresh the ingredients look and once I made these", "I was pretty much done with all my little camping hacks and it was time to enjoy the trip what are you getting you all right", "we are getting some wood for the fire there", "yes", "Oh what thank you", "oh you are so cute", "hey daddy just like Daddy", "mmm hi Oliver is filming hey are in Utah Cedar City Utah Kitty", "see me Oliver we are in", "Cedar City Utah and Oliver is filming right now and we are waiting in the warm car for daddy to build a sling I should go help him", "but I am here with Oliver Daisy", "is happy their eyes a picture", "you take the pictures", "okay", "let is see how daddy is doing out there", "and there is icicles on our chairs", "but we have a fire now if that is not a breakfast fit for a camping queen", "I do not know what is alright", "we are packed up me and all of our listening to the Star Wars soundtrack did", "you dig dig dig ding all right", "we are heading off to our next adventure", "I am the direction person", "so hopefully do not get us lost", "oh boy horses across the road", "the little guy right there too by Grand Canyon see you next time we will be back hey Oliver zooming", "and we are on our way home in some good shots but", "Vidia way", "alright so that completes this video hopefully you guys enjoyed I have a full vlog of our chip on our

family", "and I decided we wanted to go on a road trip and go camping", "we actually took a road trip up to Utah and we went back down to Albuquerque New Mexico to visit my husband is family", "it took a good amount of preparation on both my husband and my part and", "so that is why wanted to show you guys some of the things that I did some of the little hacks and the DIYs that I did for our toddler and some of the things that worked for us", "hopefully they will work for you too and your family if you are going on a trip or a road trip in the near future", "this is actually a two part series so the first part is road trip where I am making a few DIYs prepping some snacks and packing and getting ready for the road trip and then the second part is gonna be the camping DIYs and tips and tricks that I used for when we went camping so hopefully you guys enjoy this video and let is", "just jump right in", "so one thing you definitely have to think about is packing anytime you go on a trip I like to make a list I generally forget something anyway even if I do make a list one or two things", "but I will forget way more if I do not make a list I am making a list a little checklist", "we did forget a few things", "but it was not anything crazy", "but", "I mean there is generally a few things you will forget but a list will help when packing clothing for a road trip one thing I wanted to consider was packing lots of layers when I looked at the weather conditions ahead of time and that is definitely something I would recommend is looking at the weather conditions of all the places that you are gonna be visiting there was a variation of weather conditions it was gonna be warm in some places cold", "so layers is important packing layers and packing them in a really compact manner", "so that is why have this really great bag that I generally do not travel with", "I use a suitcase", "but in this case I put all my clothes in there so that it was a little bit more compact since everything had to kind of be thrown in the car", "and we had a lot we were taking with us", "so that is why tried to pack as many layers as possible the next thing I wanted to consider was the hygiene essentials of course the toothpaste and toothbrush I usually bring a travel version of those you can get those travel kits at Target and Purell hand wipes and tissue", "I get the Purell hand wipes and they are handed", "face wipes", "so they are good for dirty little toddler faces or sticky hands when you are eating in the car things like that", "so those were kind of must haves", "I have a little feminine hygiene kit I have these deodorizing wipes which are really great a few tampons", "I also brought a dry shampoo which turned out to be great for the camping days", "I have an it cosmetics lip balm that has a really light pink tinge to it", "so it is really nice", "I also have this eye cream from Olay", "this is great because it acts as an eye cream and a concealer the vitamin C moisturizer I am using right now feminine cleansing cloths and", "my vitamin C peel pads a great easy compact skincare item to travel with and", "then yes to carrots face wipes so", "I also had to pack for my son Oliver and so that is why wanted to share with you guys a few kid friendly packing tips obviously the same as me I wanted to pack lots of layers", "I got these great hiking boots from Nordstrom Rack on sale", "I also have little hunter boots I do not spend too much on his clothes", "but I do always invest a little bit more in shoes", "I also got those little Adidas on sale at Nordstrom Rack for I got a good deal on all those shoes", "so that is why also packed a few different jackets this great little pillow that my sister in law made which is great for sleeping in cars she made that for me", "I heart stitching", "is the name of her channel on YouTube", "she is awesome", "she makes a lot of cool things so packed lots and lots of layers", "I also packed some pull ups", "he is pretty much potty trained at home but", "on a road trip it is a little tricky so definitely needed enough pull ups until we could get to another location and buy more warm hats gloves enough items to", "we could layer and keep him really warm", "I also packed some activities for him", "I got a doodle", "Pro from Target", "these have been around forever and ever he loved it", "I also made a DIY Lego tray before we left", "it is really easy to make so that is why am gonna show you guys how I made it so with a baking sheet and a Lego tray", "I am going to put the Lego tray on the baking sheet you can use magnets to do this", "but I use these little kind of velcro", "you can find these at Target these are used generally to hang pictures and things on the wall", "so I am putting the first side down that I am putting the velcro over that peeling it back so that it has the sticky part and then putting the Lego trade directly on that that worked really really well", "and then I got these little magnet containers at Michaels these held really great onto the baking sheet", "and this is where I store all the little mini Legos now when I first made this my first thought", "was oh my gosh", "I am gonna have Legos all over the car", "but that is okay because it is gonna keep him busy", "but it turned out we did not have one single Lego fall he", "I do not know he just managed to keep the Legos all in one place which was kind of a miracle", "and it worked out", "well so that is why put all sorts of different types of little Legos in these containers and it was a nice big tray that he could play Legos on", "and it kept him busy definitely for a few hours on the road trip so that is why would highly recommend this if you are gonna go on a road trip", "so for the trip I am gonna make some no bake granola", "this is peanut butter granola bars and I am starting with one cup of peanut butter and a half a cup of honey I am mixing those together in a medium saucepan over medium heat", "and I am just gonna stir it until it is pretty much melted together", "then I am gonna add one and a half cups of old fashioned oats 1 2 of a teaspoon of vanilla", "and you can either use chocolate chips or shredded coconut", "I like shredded coconut", "so that is what I am gonna be using and a little tiny bit of cinnamon you can add however much you want", "and I am gonna mix that together", "I am gonna put that on a baking sheet and flatten it out a little bit with a wooden spoon and stick it in the refrigerator to harden for a bit so after it is had a chance to harden a bit in the refrigerator", "I am gonna take it out", "I am gonna make little bars basically it is granola", "but I wanted to there was big enough pieces that we could hold onto them in the car", "and this was a total hit it tasted amazing everybody loved it so on long road trips there will be times where you do not see a restaurant or a gas station for a long time", "so that is why wanted to", "I packed all of our lunch I am making one of these DIY Uncrustables", "I have made this before on my channel", "it is really easy", "it is pretty much using a cutout with your peanut butter and jelly sandwich", "I try to make a little bit of a healthier version with whole wheat bread and a little bit healthier jam and peanut butter", "but then I cut out and", "I make it look like one of those Uncrustables which you can actually freeze this and these work really great for making ahead of time", "but I am gonna put this in the little ziplock bag so that is why has a sandwich",

one on a road trip so that is why took a cereal box", "it is just a plastic cereal box", "I put a garbage bag inside there", "this worked great for the campsite", "but it also works great for our car", "we would fill up the trash bag and empty it out when we got to different stops and then as we collected bags on the way I would use it as garbage bag", "so this is a great option for sticking in the car", "and then it was time to start packing up the car which when you are packing I did not show everything in this video", "we definitely we had something on our roof that held all of our camping gear and fishing poles and different things like that", "but as far as packing the car I put the two bags", "so that is why could easily access all the pantry items I packed all of his toys right next to him", "I packed him a few extra things like the Legos I took the little Lego box and a few cars and things that I knew he could play with in the car but also when we got out of the car I packed the little trashcan that I made", "and", "I also wanted to pack a few extra little things like hand wipes tissue a flashlight things that I could easily access I put that in the little center console there", "and then I also made a kind of emergency kit with vitamins and medications and different things that I wanted to take I will talk about that more in my next video", "and then I made sure each door had a water in it", "and also I would highly recommend bringing a triple a kit when you are traveling and also a first aid kit", "I talked a little bit more about this", "and I did it cleaning out my car video", "and I talked about some of the things I keep in my car so that is why put that on the bottom of my truck", "and then I am packing up the Yeti with all of our drinks our food", "the things we took to make sandwiches and we use this for camping", "but we also used it for the road trip itself so now that the car is all packed it is time to get going all right we are off

Pop Tarts and gummy snacks", "today I am making these treats for my son", "but I also wanted to share them on my channel", "so let is jump right in", "I am starting with kool aid candy dots", "so it is pretty easy", "I am gonna whip up a simple meringue recipe you can use a hand mixer", "but I am using my stand mixer and adding one and a half cups of powdered sugar and then one egg I am going to whip this up and this is going to create a pretty basic meringue recipe you will find this in most marine cookies or different things like that", "but for today we are using this to create the dots so once that is whipped up for about five minutes", "you will notice that it has pretty stiff peaks", "I am taking that out with a spatula and putting it into four separate bowls", "now I have four separate flavors of kool aid", "and I am going to add each to each Bowl now", "obviously this is not the most healthy treat but they are small little dots and you are only supposed to have a few at a time", "and we are kind of recreating in old favorite but each of these has a very kind of tart sour but sweet flavor so that is why had a grape we had a lime we also had a berry and a blue which was like a blueberry lemon flavor", "they all tasted good and nice and sour and tangy so that is why am going to pipe these on to a sheet of wax paper", "and you can let them dry", "but if you are concerned with the raw egg you can stick them in the oven for about 15 minutes to cook them a little bit most meringue recipes contain raw egg", "but if you are concerned with this and you are serving this to kids you can stick it in the oven for about 10 to 15 minutes so that is why am piping each color as clean of a dot as I can get I did not go to clean with it because I figured we were gonna eat these pretty quick", "and I guess I could have stayed and made him perfect", "but I wanted to whip them up pretty quick so", "in my opinion these actually turned out better than the candy dots that I remember from my childhood because these were sour where the candy dots were almost like sugar", "it was more fun to peel them off the paper that was the most fun part for me", "so that is why let my son have a few of each color", "then I confiscated them because I think he would have eaten both wax paper sheets in 2 5 seconds so next we are recreating gummy snacks", "these are pretty easy to make all you need is", "a fruit juice of your choice I am using a strawberry lemonade fruit juice bringing that to a boil and then pulling it off the stove I am adding three packets of gelatin but the key with this is to add it slowly and whisk it up", "then I am going to pour that into a measuring cup", "I spilled", "a little bit remove the froth because the froth will make the gummies not look as clear so that is why learned that the last time I made that mistake and then with a strainer I am adding this to molds and in this case I have star molds", "it is a little bit of a mess", "but I made two different versions I made a Concord grape and a strawberry lemonade", "and then you are going to want to stick those in the refrigerator", "these should be set up for about four hours", "and then they will be ready to go", "and you can pull them out and they will come out pretty clean from the molds", "now I tried to look for a vegan recipe for this", "but I could not find anything that would create that gelatin effect without gelatin so if any of you have tips leave it in the comments below because I would love to test out a vegan version of these so finally I wanted to make some pop tarts these are relatively easy to make actually surprisingly", "I started with the jam first", "so that is why have a variation of frozen berries I am putting that in a small saucepan", "and I am adding some coconut sugar", "and then I am putting a top on the saucepan", "now do not judge me", "but I could not find the top for this saucepan", "so I used a large one and next I am moving into the dough", "so that is why have two cups of whole wheat pastry flour", "and then I am going to add a pinch of salt", "then I am going to cut in 2 3 cup of cold vegan butter in this case I am using Earth Balance which is actually a butter I really like to use on toast", "and it is a great alternative for butter", "so that is why am cutting that into the dry ingredients", "and then I am adding about four tablespoons of ice cold water very slowly into this mixture", "and then I am going to combine that until it creates a dough so that will take some time you just need a fork so once the dough starts to look combined", "I am gonna go check on my jam just it is doing", "okay", "I am going to crush the berries", "a little bit put the top back on let that cook a little bit more as I roll out my dough I did not have the proper top for that pan", "so do not mind me on a floured surface I am going to roll out the dough with a rolling pin", "and then I am going to create pop tart shapes as best as I can in this particular case", "I used the back of one of my little Pyrex containers or my oxo containers or whatever to create four different shapes", "so I am going to make two pop tarts for right now for this video", "but I had some leftover dough", "so that is why could make more later", "so obviously you want the top and the bottom portion I am going to fill the inside with the jam and then put the top on to completely close off the jam inside the pop tart I am going to press it down with my fingers", "and I am going to do that again for the second pop tart", "so you want to that", "the jam is completely closed off so that is why can press that down with your fingers and you can also cut it to make the edges smooth", "I also took a fork to kind of give it that traditional pop tart edge look", "and I was always a fan of the plain pop tarts", "and I put a few little dashes on top so that is why would say this is like a pop tart", "but it was also kind of like a berry tart a homemade berry tart", "and it turned out flaky and delicious", "I thought it tasted amazing", "I was super happy with how this turned out", "I am always worried that it is not going to turn out or taste good", "but this actually tasted good", "and I brushed the top with a little bit more of the vegan butter put a little bit of the coconut sugar on top of that at the beginning of this", "I preheated the oven to 350 degrees so that you do that", "and you want to cook it for about 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown", "and then they will be finished crispy delicious vegan pop tarts a little bit healthier than the ones you can find at the stores but still reminiscent of that same delicious recipe that I loved as a kid", "so hopefully you guys enjoyed this video", "and you

of Oliver", "is favorite cars he is obsessed with cars and", "I also made some pretty easy DIY chalk that turned out great and worked well since my son turned about 2 I have been liking to make these videos because they make him so happy they have become kind of a thing in our household", "and he gets very excited every time I film one of these kids", "DIY videos", "sometimes I fail miserably at these", "but he always still appreciates it and has fun and today is worked out", "pretty well", "so I am starting first and foremost with the robot crayons", "now technically you can make crayons on any shape or color that you prefer I have two boxes of crayons here", "and I am collecting a few of the same color", "and I am removing the paper", "and I am breaking them into bowls I am using bowls that I can bake with and", "they are also flexible so that is why are great for pouring into the molds a little bit later", "so that is why am choosing a few different colors such as green orange red and blue", "I am breaking them up and putting them into the bowls and I am going to bake that so that is why am baking it 350 degrees until it is completely melted", "keep an eye on them in the oven", "but it generally takes about 10 to 15 minutes for them to melt completely mine had a little bit that still needed to be melted but as soon as I stirred it it seemed to melt pretty completely", "and I have different popsicle sticks for each Bowl", "so once it is completely melted I am pouring this into the robot mold", "so what I liked about these is you can actually customize them", "however you want so if you can find molds and your favorite movies or TV shows or if you wanted to make traditional shapes like a heart or a star", "I love this because you can customize crayons and kids", "find it at least my child loved this he loved it", "so that is why am pouring all the different colors into the molds I am gonna make solid crayons and then", "I also decided to make two tone crayons so in this case I have red and orange", "and then I added a little bit of green", "and it was pretty cool because once these dried and I pulled them out some of their bellies were like a different color than the rest of their body", "it looked really fun", "so I had a good time with it and after about six hours", "they should be completely dry you can pull them out", "and I was happy with how they turned out", "he liked him because he played with them like they were some of his guys", "but he could also color with them", "so that is why stored these in a ziploc bag and", "these were actually great", "we took these on an airplane trip we recently went on and also we are taking them on another trip were going on we have not lost any yet which is like amazing", "and he loves it", "he uses it in his coloring book", "and he plays with them like little guys as well you can use them like this you can use their legs", "so the crayons were a success and now I wanted to try a cardboard toy garage", "now I had seen these all over Pinterest and people made a very different", "some people went super extravagant some people went super simple", "but I knew I wanted to make one for my son because he is obsessed with cars so that is why took an old shopping box", "I taped up the bottom", "and then I am cutting the flaps which this was actually harder than I thought it was going to be", "I actually was like starting to break a sweat cutting a box at least maybe with the scissors I had", "maybe they were not very sharp", "but it took me some time so once I did that then it was time to build the structure", "so that is why had a top portion of the garage", "and I am gonna create a little ramp to go to the bottom portion", "I have another garage I want to make for him in the future that is pretty much all toilet paper rolls", "so I got the colored ones at Michaels for pretty cheap", "and then I built a ramp and a few different signs I am using tape", "but you can use glue or a hot glue gun", "depends on how long you think it is going to last with a sharpie I made some spaces for him to park his car", "and I put lines down the ramp so it looked like a road I cut two doors I have a going in door and a coming out door", "so this is usually the area where you pay going into a parking garage", "so that is why put an arrow going in and an arrow going out", "so he knows which ways to put his car and the ramp comes down to the exit", "so I do not know I was trying to make it look as fun and interesting as possible", "and like I said you can go as crazy as you want with this", "so that is why played with this so much actually that it I did not structurally make it strong enough", "so if I make another parking garage in the future I want to make it stronger so we can last longer because he liked it and after a few days it kind of was like it was disheveled", "so that is why made an exit and enter sign so that is why can kind of start reading signs and know which ways his cars go", "I also made a little parking sign and the cool thing is like I said you can customize it", "you can go crazy with it", "and it is a fun way for your kid to play with the toy cars he really really loved", "it had a good time with it", "and I want to make another one another parking garage in the future for sure we are now moving on to the DIY chalk now I am also using toilet paper rolls", "these are recycled toilet paper rolls you can either buy them in bulk at Michaels or you can save up for them yourself because obviously we all use toilet paper so that is why can save the toilet paper rolls I am cutting some wax paper to fit into the toilet paper rules we are gonna have some giant chalk I could not figure out any other molds that would have worked for this chalk to make it thinner", "so that is why just decided to go with giant toilet paper roll size chalk so that is why am taping off one side of the toilet paper roll", "I am going to", "I do a pretty good job because I am going to be pouring liquid into these", "so that is why am taping off each and every one of them trying to", "it is completely sealed we are mixing non toxic plaster of paris and water together I will put the exact measurements in the description", "this is going to create the plaster or the chalk", "then you want non toxic paint in the colors that you choose I decided to make a few different colors but I made an orange", "I also made a pink color blue yellow", "but again you can customize this however you want and make whichever colors you want more of one color less of another color", "but then I am pouring that into a ziploc", "and I am cutting the tip so that is why am going to be piping that into the open side of the toilet paper roll", "and I am going to do that for all of these in the different colors look upon day all in my blue skies for chalk", "this big it definitely needed to dry overnight and then in the morning I took out the toilet paper roll and took off the tape remove the wax paper there was a tiny bit of wax paper stuck", "so that is why had to kind of go through and remove that probably because I did not do a perfect cylinder for the wax paper", "but it ended up turning out totally great", "my son waited impatiently as I took everything apart", "and then we went outside right away and played with the chalk", "it is huge chalk", "but it works really great", "and we had a lot of fun with it", "so that is why would definitely recommend this one as well", "so this was a successful DIY kids", "day I have not always been successful with these videos even though I put them up anyway", "but I think it is fun to do this", "my son always gets really excited about these videos he kept running around saying it is my birthday", "it is my

["hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I am doing an epic at home facial", "I d like to do a facial once a week if I get a chance to", "but lately I have not been as good about it", "and I do it maybe every other week or once a month some people like to collect makeup or other things", "I have always been extremely fascinated with skincare so that is why have all these crazy gadgets and it was an industry I worked in for about five years and", "was always fascinated with so today I am doing an updated facial and sharing with you some new gadgets and tools so let is jump right in let is start with the basics the things that you want to have to perform an at home facial", "this is a cleanser", "I definitely recommend a good cleanser I am using a milk cleanser right now a scrub that you love using one by Janka also two masks I like to do a detox mask and then a very gentle hydrating mask after the detox mask I like these facial sponges I use that with the cleanser", "but you could certainly use a Clarisonic if you already have that", "but I do like facial sponges you can get that for a pretty good price on Amazon", "and then a facial brush for applying the mask and then a good moisturizer", "so that completes the list of skin care products that I like to use when I am performing an at home facial", "but", "I also love skincare gadgets and tools and I have collected my fair share I do love the cleansing sponges you can find those off of Amazon", "I have a Clarisonic which I did not show here", "but I like the cleansing sponges which are a lot more affordable", "I also like a facial steamer I had a con air one all growing up", "I asked for one for my birthday when I was young and", "it was really great", "you can also use a bowl of hot water which will produce steam", "and I have shown that before on my channel", "but this one projects steam", "it is very similar to what they use when you are getting a professional facial", "so that is why love that one I have an LED face mask", "this was a recent purchase I have had LED face treatments performed on my skin before they are fabulous and", "I also had a handheld LED light before that was given to me", "but I had to go all around my face with it", "and I liked this one because it covers all your face at once", "and it has different lights", "so it had the green for hyperpigmentation blue for acne", "it actually has a few different colors that have different effects on the skin", "but I will talk a little bit more about that later in the video", "I also have a microcurrent device which is more for the firming and toning of the muscle under the skin", "and I do not use that as often", "and I wo not use that in today is facial", "but I have talked about that before in my channel so that is why am going to start first by diffusing some bedtime lavender essential oil and my doTERRA diffuser", "I am adding some water to my facial steamer I am turning it on and in about 15 seconds it is going to start projecting some steam I am going to wet my sponges and get those ready they are going to puff out a little bit I am going to put a headband in my hair so that I pull my hair back", "and then I am going to begin by cleansing my skin with a cleanser", "like I said you want to choose a cleanser that works for you right now", "I am using a milk cleanser I am using the goat milk", "cleanser by Kate Somerville", "I am adding a little bit on to the facial sponges and", "I am going to go ahead and start cleansing my skin now the difference between in everyday cleanse and", "an epic facial cleanse is today I am cleansing my skin directly over the facial steamer so the facial steamer is projecting the steam", "and I am far enough back that it is not burning my skin but enough that I am cleansing so that this steam is over my skin and generally when you are getting a facial", "they do project steam on your skin while they are cleansing and exfoliating so that is why am starting by cleansing", "and then I am going to wash my face with lukewarm water", "then I am going to move on to a scrub", "right now I am using the Janka scrub", "I am actually almost finished with this scrub", "this is a physical scrub so that is why have", "chemical and physical scrubs physical is just like it sounds", "it has little granules or beads in the scrub that physically as opposed to a chemical exfoliant which exfoliates your skin with either lactic or glycolic acid usually", "an acid Ajay is so that is why am going to gently massage this into my skin for about a solid minute and then wash it off", "so I am going to gently dry my skin with a towel", "and then I am going to apply a face mask", "usually I use a detox mask or a mud mask first", "so that is why am going to use this derma dr detox mask", "and I am going to use it with a facial brush which I saved this one from another mask that I use which is the glam glow", "I think I finished it up and this brush came with it so that is why saved it and washed it", "you can find these on Amazon as well though", "and then I am going to use this to apply the face mask", "now I am not always good about using a face brush", "but I have been trying to be better about it lately", "sometimes I stick my fingers in the products but it is always good to use a brush if you can", "so that is why use that when I am performing a facial I am going to let my skin sit over the steamer with a face mask for about five minutes", "and then I am going to pull away and let it dry on my skin it wo not be able to dry if you stay under the steam the entire time", "so that is why steam it for a little bit and then let it dry while it is drying I try to drink lots of water to stay hydrated", "and then I remove it with the facial sponges and some warm water", "this next step is optional but I like to layer masks so after I use a detox mask", "sometimes I like to use a hydrating mask a very gentle Rose mask", "like this one from fresh it smells nice and it just kind of leaves your skin really refreshed and hydrated so that is why am going to apply this with the facial brush that I cleansed and use this on my face and neck", "let it sit for about 15 to 20 minutes and then remove it with some warm water and the facial sponges and that pretty much completes the treatments that I will perform I am going to dry my skin off with a towel and add a little bit of moisturizer and a lip balm I am using the same moisturizer that I use every day and lip balm that I use everyday", "but I like to", "I keep my lips and skin hydrated obviously and then next it is time for the fun part which is whipping out one of the gadgets that I choose to use on whatever I am feeling for my skin so tonight I am using the LED red light so the LED red light produces a wavelength outside of the skin damaging UV range that we normally fear in tanning beds and things like that in studies performed by NASA", "it was scientifically proven to be effective in healing the skin so many expensive spas charge a lot to perform these treatments", "so I got this on Amazon", "I use it as often as possible and sure I look a little crazy but", "it makes a huge difference I use the red and white light in combination as often as possible", "so that is my idea of an epic facial it might be crazy for some people", "but I love it", "hopefully you

a little bit made some DIY dryer sheets and stain remover", "so today I am going to show you guys a few things that I did for the laundry room starting with the DIY ironing board in my house", "I have a very small laundry room and there is no space to iron in that room but", "outside the laundry room I have a kind of empty space so that is why decided to make a custom ironing board for that space",

cut for you to fit whatever size you need", "this was five dollars for this size", "and then I got cotton batting and fabric from the fabric store I usually wait till there is a sailor till I have a coupon to get my fabric", "and then I am also using a heavy duty stapler to just staple the cotton batting down", "and then the fabric over that", "and I try to get it as clean as possible on the bottom side", "but you do not have to worry too much about that", "and you can make this in any size so if you want to do a size that works for a college dorm or you want to do one that works for your bedroom you can customize it to any size and you do not have to be kind of confined to a traditional iron size", "so this project was a bit intimidating to me at first", "I do not know why", "but it was very easy", "and I am gonna go ahead and iron the actual fabric itself because it was a bit wrinkly", "this gave me a lot of ironing space I tend to use my steamer and kind of avoid ironing just because I had such a small ironing board", "so that is why wanted to always find a way to use this space for ironing larger amounts at a time you can iron jeans", "you can even iron sheets it gives lots of space plus", "you can customize this to any size for whatever your environment is next", "I am making do it yourself reusable scented drawing sheets you want to look for fabric that is a light color so either white or grey like this try not to do reds or things like that that might bleed into your clothes", "but I am cutting them into squares and", "I am gonna put them in this container which I got for 2 at HomeGoods", "and I am going to add some vinegar and some essential oils you add about 30 or so drops of your favorite essential oils", "and it will leave your clothes smelling nice", "so that is why am putting that in this container", "I also got a few other containers in various sizes for the different laundry products that I use", "and I decided to put everything in these containers which each of them were under about 10 at HomeGoods", "so that is why recommend going and getting a few different containers there for your laundry room if that is something that you are interested in doing one of the containers", "has the pods that I use", "I also have the powder detergent and the DIY dryer sheets that I made and also an extra one for miscellaneous items that are found in the pockets of the clothes so that is why am going to use the dryer sheets you want to take about three or four of them and put them in the dryer", "before you start your load it is going to freshen up your load", "and it is also going to make it smell nice", "and it is not going to make it smell like vinegar", "so do not worry and you can actually reuse them when you are done so the miscellaneous items I throw any change or anything that I find in pockets that need to be returned to a spot I put them in there first", "and then you can take out the dryer sheets when you are done with your load and you can stick them right back into the reusable dryer sheets you can make a fresh version of this after you have gone through all of them a few times which you know you can go through that pretty quick and the next I really like these command stick on hooks you can find these at Target or Home Depot and you can peel off the back and just stick them on", "they hold up to five pounds so my long cabinet in my laundry room kind of had everything stuffed in there the broom the mop and things like that", "so that is why decided to get these stick these on the wall", "these are great because they are easy and they hold a lot and also if you are renting a place or if you are renting an apartment or whatever these are also great too because you can take them right off", "and they do not affect the wall", "so I went and hung everything my Swiffer my steam mop my broom", "I put my vacuum in there as well", "and I made sure everything was cleaned up because like I said this room was kind of a disaster zone and it is small", "so that is why just wanted to I got everything together in here", "I also have some of my favorite hand soap because I do one great thing in about my laundry room", "is I do have a sink in there also", "if you want to go the extra mile you can add some flowers in your laundry room just to kind of brighten it up a little bit", "it is kind of", "you know it is a laundry room", "so that is why know", "but next we are making a quick DIY stain", "remover it is two parts hydrogen peroxide to one part dish soap and you can get these droppers I got mine at sprouts you there about two bucks you can also find them on Amazon", "I believe Whole Foods carries them as well you could drop a little bit of that stain remover on a stain and use a damp cloth to kind of gently rub the stain until it comes out so that is why am going to actually add a label so everybody in my house is aware of what this is", "I keep a lot of other things in the laundry room above the sink", "is kind of where I want to keep things that are away from my son", "he is almost three and he does not get into too much", "but I do like to keep these things out of his reach I have quite an extensive essential oil collection because I have been collecting over the last few years for my channel so that is why could do more home DIYs and things like that", "and I love them", "and I use them all the time I also keep extra vinegar outdoor cleaning products the cleaning toothbrush some soap a first aid kit and", "then another great tip for your laundry room is to have a little symbol chart and add that to a frame you can put that in your laundry room as a reminder to everybody as well to read the tags and they are cleaning everything properly so things do not shrink so sometimes if I have a housekeeper come and help me or she is helping me out with my laundry on times", "Byron is doing the laundry or any of us", "forget we can take a look at that shirt", "and we know what the label means and how to appropriately wash our clothes so after assessing my laundry room and deciding I needed to make a few changes", "these were", "some of the changes I made some of the DIYs I decided to try out if you like these types of videos be sure to thumbs up this video and subscribe to my channel check out some of my other videos my other channel", "and I will see you guys in the next video bye"], "Bbt9TR9ZTdI": ["hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I am cleaning up the bathroom which is never the most fun task", "but today I am going to share a few tips that work for me", "I find so many great hacks and tips on Pinterest", "and I generally tweak them a bit and use ingredients that I already have and that suit my needs", "so I wanted to share with you some of the tips that work for me and the ones that I use", "and so that is what today is video", "is", "all about so let is go fit in", "so let is start with the DIY toilet fizzy bombs", "I do not think anyone enjoys cleaning toilets but these are easy fizzy toilet bombs and you get a little extra help when you are cleaning your toilet", "so I had the ingredients in my cabinet already because I have made a variety of different fizzy bombs for my channel", "all you need is baking soda and citric acid you are going to slowly add the water so that the ingredients mix together but do not fill up", "and then you are going to add a few essential oils of your choice", "right now I have a good amount of lemon and lavender in my essential oil collection", "so that is why am going to mix those two together and add them to the mix", "so you want to add the mixture to ice cube trays and stick that in the freezer for about an hour", "then you can add one or two to the toilet and use a scrub brush if needed and this is going to help clean the toilet and also give it a nice scent as well once it is done fizzing up", "you can just flush the toilet like normal and continue on next", "we are making DIY poo pourri when I first heard of poo pourri I could not help but think it was a total joke until I tried it and realized it actually works pretty amazing", "but you can easily make something similar at home with water witch hazel and essential oils", "so again I am using lavender and lemon and adding these ingredients to a glass spray bottle I will have the exact measurements below", "but I am going to spray this over the surface of the toilet water before you go number two", "and it adds a scented barrier to help prevent from excessive odor so anyway moving on from the toilet we are moving into a very easy DIY surface spray which I have made before on my channel", "but it is very easy to make its equal parts water and vinegar and essential oils of your choice you can use it to clean the surface of your bathroom", "sink it also disinfect and clean", "so that is why can use it on most surface areas", "some areas do not respond well to vinegar", "so you can keep that in mind", "but this is generally a very good surface right and very very easy to make lemon can be used for so many different things and one thing it works really well for which I actually did not realize until recently", "was that you can use it on the hardware of your showers", "your bath", "your sink", "basically you rub it", "and then you wipe it down with a cloth that is a little bit damp and you have this beautiful shiny hardware", "and so I love lemon for that I do not use it with salt on the hardware because that can scratch but the lemon by itself disinfects and also makes it super shiny vinegar I am learning", "is another ingredient that is multi purpose and works for so many different things so sometimes your showerhead will get kind of grimy", "and if you take an old shirt or a white towel and soak it in vinegar and wrap it around your showerhead and leave it for about 20 minutes or so it is going to help with the water buildup", "and it is going to allow the water to flow a little bit more clean and smoothly", "so I tried this out", "I really loved this one it worked really great", "and then I made sure to clean the shower I ran it really quickly to", "I got the vinegar smell out", "and then I wiped it down with a towel again to get it nice and shiny", "and it worked like a time for the shower doors I am adding equal parts vinegar and water to a spray bottle", "and I am going to use this to clean my shower doors I am avoiding essential oils because those can cause streaking", "and I have found that out the hard way so for this one you want to keep it with vinegar and water and that will also get your doors nice and shiny", "we also use one of those little squeegees after every shower we tried to start making that a habit in our house and that definitely helps now if you have jets in your bathtub use powder dishwasher detergent to clean bathtub", "Jets I do not do this very often but every few months your jets need to be thoroughly cleaned out and powdered dishwasher detergent", "does the trick", "so that is why can also use a toothbrush for cleaning around the Jets and the inside but", "one thing I would really recommend is to be sure to label it", "so I labeled it cleaning so that it does not end up in anyone", "is mouth so that is why am adding enough water to fill up the bath to above the Jets", "I prefer not to fill up the bath all the way because I am trying to avoid wasting any more water than is necessary for this", "but it is important to get anything that is been stuck in the Jets for a long time out", "so that is why am turning on the jet", "and I am letting it run for about five minutes while that runs I am actually going to clean the floors I got a steam mop off of Amazon after a bunch of you suggested to me that I get one in my kitchen cleaning video", "I am obsessed", "I add a few drops of lemon essential oil on the bottom of the mop", "and then I turn on the mop to the scrub setting this", "is so much better than what I was using before I was using a traditional mop from Target which is not bad", "but this takes it to the next level", "it makes cleaning the floors a breeze", "so that is why can use it all over your house", "it is steam", "but when you add the lemon essential oil on the bottom of the mop it releases a nice scent", "so I highly recommend it", "I love it", "and then I am going to turn off the Jets and", "you are going to see all the grime that came out of them", "so now it is time to clean the bathtub itself", "and you can clean a regular bath tub with a refillable sponge I like to add equal parts vinegar and liquid dish soap into the sponge", "and then you can press the button and the solution comes out through the sponge", "and you just scrub the bathtub until it gets nice and clean", "so that is why love this tip for cleaning out the bathtub", "and these are my tips for cleaning your bathroom a bit more", "naturally chemicals can be really harsh and especially in a small space like the bathroom", "it can be even more harsh so not do these tips work", "but they are a bit healthier too", "so that is why hope you enjoyed this video check out my last two", "and I will see you guys in the next one"], "SfyHFldmw0k": ["hey guys welcome back to my channel today", "is another fall inspired video except we are going to be making some DIY skincare such as scrubs face masks foot scrubs and bath salts usually when you go to a spa around this time of the year they will kind of customize your treatments to be a little bit more fall inspired", "so that is why thought I would do a video fall inspired", "so let is jump right in", "so let is start with the first recipe the vanilla latte body scrub which smells absolutely amazing", "it is pretty easy to make and it is great for your skin", "so that is why want 1 2 of a cup of brown sugar 1 4 of a cup of finely ground coffee 1 tablespoon of unflavored almond milk 1 tablespoon of coconut oil and about a dash of vanilla extract then you are going to want to give that a really good mix", "and you can store this for up to a week", "you can use this scrub all over your body", "but I would definitely focus on areas where you are concerned with cellulite or firming because coffee contains caffeine and the caffeine definitely wakes up the skin and firms it", "so it is a great overall body scrub but great for your thighs and your bum", "and it smells amazing as well", "so definitely try that one out", "the next one is equally as divine and this is the pumpkin pie body scrub i eyeballed the recipe", "and I ran out of brown sugar so that is why am taking about 1 2 of a cup of granulated sugar", "and then I am also adding some coconut oil I would say about one or two tablespoons here", "and then I am also adding vanilla so very similar to the last scrub but for this scrub all you need to do is add 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice now if you have very sensitive skin you can omit this but and this does not have any particular benefits for the skin in and of itself", "but it does make the scrub smell absolutely amazing like you want to eat it actually", "you could", "it is totally edible", "but it is the most delicious smelling body scrub ever", "and you can use this all over your body next", "we are making the pumpkin peel facemask pumpkins are packed with fruit enzymes and also contain vitamin A and vitamin C which helps soften and soothe the skin and boost collagen production so we are going to be making a face mask I am starting with 1 tablespoon of manuka honey and", "then two heaping tablespoons of organic canned pumpkin so that is why am kind of eyeballing it here", "but two big spoonfuls of organic canned pumpkin next I am going to add one tablespoon of unflavored almond milk so instead of the vanilla flavor get the unflavored and add that and then a half of a tablespoon of coconut oil you can kind of eyeball it because you do not want too much oil in there but a little bit of coconut oil and that is going to really soften the skin so that is why are going to apply this on your skin", "and you will notice a little tiny bit of redness after because it does have a mild exfoliating effect on the skin", "but this is a great mask to try out if you want to try out a very gentle pumpkin peel", "enzyme mask generally when I do a mask especially in at home face masks I like to bring the mask down my neck down my chest on my arms and", "about 15 or 20 minutes after it is on you are going to want to remove it and wash your skin with a little bit of water", "not cleanser but wash it with a little bit of water and then next we are going to be making a pumpkin foot scrub and apple cider foot soak so for the pumpkin scrub we again are using the canned pumpkin", "so very similar", "I am kind of eyeballing everything here", "so that is why have approximately 1 cup of the organic canned pumpkin", "and then I am adding 1 4 of a cup of very coarse sea salt", "or I have Maldon salt which I added here I am mixing that together", "and then I am going to add one or two drops of peppermint essential oil", "this is obviously going to leave your feet smelling nice and the pumpkin puree is going to act as an exfoliant", "so this is going to be great for a little at home pedicure as I have shown in previous nail care videos", "I like to create a little bath for my feet to soak in I am going to soak my feet in apple cider vinegar for about 10 minutes", "then I am going to take my feet out", "and I am going to scrub my feet with the pumpkin scrub", "and then after I am going to add a little bit of this great pumpkin body butter that I find at Trader Joe", "is this is for all over your body as well", "but I am going to really moisturize my feet", "finally we are going to make some fall inspired bath salts we are making cinnamon and orange bath salts", "all you need is Epsom salt which I always have this in my house", "you can find it at sprouts or your local grocery store or Rite Aid any of those types of stores", "will carry epson salt you can take baths in Epsom salt", "but I am just adding a few different essential oils such as the cinnamon clove and also the orange so that is why want to give that a nice mix", "and I like to store my bath salts in little glass jars that I get on Amazon um this way", "you can store them and use them for a longer period of time I create a little funnel with some paper", "I do not have a funnel in my house right now which I probably should I should buy one they are not that offensive", "but I use a piece of paper", "and I funnel in the bath salts and that way you can use about half for your first round", "and then if you want to take another bath the next week or whenever you can use the rest of it", "so that is why do like to save that", "and then I am going to just add that to my bath", "I have my little pumpkin candle in the background I showed how to make those last year", "last fall videos", "I showed how to make those little pumpkin tea lights and also you can add the clove cinnamon and orange essential oil to your diffuser and that will give a very similar effect to the pot pourri that we have made in previous videos", "it is a very similar set without having to worry about having something on the stove so if you have a diffuser definitely try mixing those together this fall season so that completes this video hopefully you guys enjoyed it", "and it gave you some good tips", "do not forget to check out my last few videos that I put up this week which we are all fall themed", "and I will see you guys next week for some new videos bye you"], "tcEibo1tvls": ["for today is fall themed video I am going to be making some homemade recipes starting with some homemade chai tea", "we have some pumpkin cinnamon butter which was super yummy vegan pumpkin waffles which turned out delicious and great and also some vegan butternut squash soup", "so that is why am excited to share these recipes with you and let is just jump right in", "so let is start with a homemade chai latte", "first you are going to want to start with 2 cups of water 1 2 of a cup of almond milk so that is why want to mix those two together", "and then I am going to add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract", "and then you are going to want to start adding your spices", "this is what gives it that chai tea that natural chai tea flavor", "so that is why am using 1 4 teaspoon or a dash of ground cloves ground cardamom nutmeg ground ginger and cinnamon", "so give that a good whisk you want to all your spices are whisked and incorporated with the almond milk and water", "and then we are going to add 1 tablespoon of brown sugar", "whisk the brown sugar until it is completely dissolved and then pour this mixture into a medium sized saucepan and bring it to a boil I like to continue to whisk as it is heating up to everything", "is incorporated and then once it is brought to a boil you are going to pull it off the stove", "and then you are going to add three or four black tea bags depending on how strong you like your chai tea", "so that is why used three", "and I am going to let that steep for about five to six minutes", "and then you have some wonderful homemade chai tea that is not too sweet not artificial tasting but a really great fall treat", "so next we are moving into the whipped cinnamon pumpkin butter which is absolutely delicious so that is why am starting with two sticks of unsalted butter", "I am adding that to my KitchenAid mixer if you do not have a KitchenAid mixer you can certainly use a hand mixer", "I have always wanted one of these my whole life", "and I never got one until I married a chef", "but I am putting my attachments in which I finally learned to use um the right way the last few years", "and I absolutely love this", "so this is a great investment for sure I am whipping up that butter so it will take about a minute", "and we will be pretty whipped", "and then I am going to pull that down take my spatula and scrape down the edges", "and I am going to add a few ingredients starting with pumpkin puree I have a total of 1 4 cup of pumpkin puree", "but I am adding 2 tablespoons at first 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 4 TSP ground nutmeg", "and then I am going to go ahead and whip that", "together until it is fully incorporated and then once that is whipped I can add the rest of the pumpkin puree and then the other ingredients that I will be adding are a fourth cup of honey which you can omit and use agave if you prefer agave over honey", "and then I am going to use 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and then a pinch of salt", "and then I am going to go ahead and whip that until that is fully incorporated and you have your cinnamon pumpkin butter", "this tastes great over the pumpkin waffles that we are going to be making but it also tastes great with some toast", "it is a really nice kind of addition to have at maybe like a fall get together", "but it is so good", "and it lasts in the refrigerator for a few days I would say up to a week", "probably Oliver said it looks like ice cream when I scooped it out", "and it is really the best when it is first fresh and whipped because once you put it in the refrigerator it hardens a little bit so you can keep it out", "and it is a wonderful whipped butter for a special fall event", "and it tastes so so heavenly", "so that is why would definitely try this recipe", "so next we have the vegan pumpkin waffle recipe so that is why am starting with 1 4 cup pumpkin", "puree", "then I am going to be adding 1 tablespoon of coconut oil", "you want to it", "is in its liquid state", "you can also use vegetable oil or grapeseed oil", "but I prefer coconut 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract 2 teaspoons sugar 1 cup of all purpose flour and 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 4 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pumpkin spice", "I will put the ingredients in the description basically I am going to sift the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients then finally I am going to add some almond milk", "or you can use soy milk", "I have 1 cup of almond milk", "and then I am going to whisk this all together", "and this is our batter", "and I have a waffle maker", "this is a waffle recipe so it does not work as pancakes but", "there are different variations you can do of this recipe", "but I have this waffle maker that I am going to make my waffles in I", "am going to add a little bit of coconut oil so that the waffle mix does not stick", "and then I am going to start ladling a little bit of the mix", "and I am going to make kind of smaller not so perfect looking waffles", "I guess more you know waffles with more character", "so that is why am adding a little bit of my waffle mix", "and then I am going to close the waffle maker and let it cook for this particular recipe you are going to want to your waffle maker is on medium to hot as you can see the temperature is turned up pretty high", "and this is a very thick batter so that is why are going to want to", "that it is turned on pretty high you so once you have made the amount of waffles that you want stack them up nicely", "and if you want you can add maple syrup", "and if you want you can also add the pumpkin cinnamon butter now if you want to keep these purely vegan", "obviously do not add the butter maybe just the maple syrup by itself", "but these were super yummy and very very flavorful definitely", "a little thicker and not as fluffy as maybe a traditional recipe but very very good", "so next we are going to move into the butternut squash soup", "this is also a vegan recipe so that is why am going to start by dicing up some vegetables for this soup", "I have one medium uncooked butternut squash which I am going to dice up that you obviously do not include the seeds", "I also have two carrots that I am going to peel and dice up", "then I have one granny smith apple", "and I am going to cut that also omitting these seeds and the core", "this adds a really nice flavor to the soup", "so I definitely recommend adding the granny smith apple", "there is a slight difference that it makes when you add the apple", "and then I am going to cut up one onion I am going to dice that up", "and then I am also going to add some garlic I tend to go light on garlic so that is why am just using two small garlic cloves and just chopping those up and adding that to the mix now this is going to be a slow cooker recipe I am going to do more slow cooker recipe soon", "but I love my crock pot", "so that is why am going to throw everything into the crock pot", "and then I am going to add vegetable stock two cups of vegetable stock", "then I am going to add some pepper and some salt to taste this", "is totally up to you how much you want to add", "I always say you know go a little light on the salt and pepper you can always add more later and then a pinch of ground cinnamon and nutmeg and a little bit of cayenne pepper I d say about an eighth of a teaspoon or a little bit more if you like it spicy", "and then some sage", "I am also going to add half of a cup of canned coconut milk and that is what is going to give it its creamy", "is super super delicious I am gonna let this cook for about five to six hours on high at", "will actually medium", "I would say if it is six hours it would be medium four hours on high and so that is why am going to put on my top", "and you can just let this sit then", "once it is had a chance to cook over a four or six hours depending on if you use high or medium heat you are going to take it and ladle it into a blender I have the Vitamix here", "we got this as a wedding gift", "and we have had it ever since this is another great kitchen investment the Vitamix because you can do so many different things with it so that is why am just labeling the soup into there", "and I am going to blend it on high until it is a creamy soup", "so when you are done blending you can ladle it out into a bowl I am going to add a little bit of olive oil on top with some salt and pepper", "and I am going to garnish it with a little bit of the sage", "and this was a really great recipe it turned out super delicious", "everybody in my family liked it", "so it is definitely a winner and a great recipe for fall", "so hopefully you guys enjoyed these recipes and you

little bit for this video", "then I am making some do it yourself crafts with my friend Angelique she came over to help me make some", "and then later that night I decorated my house", "and", "I also made some pumpkin seeds so that is why am sharing it all with you guys some fun traditions that I like to do for my family", "and hopefully you guys will enjoy this video", "it will give you some inspiration for this fall", "so let is jump right in growing up", "I had a friend and every time I go to her house", "the house would always smell amazing in the fall and her mom would have orange zest and clove and cinnamon simmering on the stove it also was a house that was always decorated nicely", "and her mom always made the most wonderful delicious meal so it was a welcoming environment",

before", "but this year I started with apple peel", "and I loved it", "so I have that brewing", "and you just basically have it simmering keep an eye on it as its simmering", "but it is a great way to have your house smell amazing for guests", "so that is why invited my friend Angelique over", "she also has a channel on YouTube super cute very similar to kind of what I do", "we have a lot in common", "yes", "so that is why are making", "so DIYs and some of them are going to be for my place and some for her place", "and we are going to show you guys how we kind of decorated it", "so that is why are starting with these mason jars and we are gonna paint them with fall colors", "so here we have some chalk paint that you can find at Michaels and we are painting some mason jars you can fill these with candles or flowers", "they are really easy to make and", "last year I went for a clean simple more classic feel so if that is your style definitely check out last year is decorating videos this year I wanted to go for more colors for sure if you have kids", "it is really fun or if you enjoy colors in general instead of neutrals", "I think it is really pretty", "so that is why are gonna start first and foremost by painting these", "and then we are going to decorate them", "so the initial red color that we had was a little too stop sign red", "so we added green and red together to make this fabulous maroon color that looks a lot more like fall so these are supposed so", "for mine we are gonna go all the way around", "okay", "how is that yep that is the thing too", "you can totally customize it to me", "I always say this on my channel", "you kind of do it", "if the whole point is to be creative we each decided to decorate our mason jars a little bit different so for mine", "I took burlap ribbon and I am adding letters so that all four spell out the word fall", "are you gonna paint on yours", "or you are just gonna do the burlap by itself", "I think just the burlap", "well I like it creative expression that is what we are going for it", "see maybe what my vision look like that might work if I tie it tight and tight the other for sure", "skills are lacking do you need help with your butt", "I might need your truly bow making skills dude", "you have to like make a lot of bows at some point", "my mom and I one year decided that each game we would all have different bows like that", "was our thanks", "my mom made we literally had a whole counter full of ribbon", "and we made different types of bows for different games so like we did cute little ones huge ones", "oh so much fun", "I love it", "mom", "and I literally sat there and made just maybe", "your own day long cheer bows", "yes what are you doing realness", "we were both sort of winging it", "a little bit she tied her burlap and I decided to glue mine from behind", "so then you can put flowers in them and you can put them around your house", "you", "okay", "so now we are going to be making these little trick or treat bags so that is why can pass these out to all your little trick or treaters if you want", "I mean it d be a lot to make it so maybe like special trick or treaters like your neighbors using a few", "are like your neighbors", "you um so you can either do it", "I thought these little burlaps just by themselves if you put some candy and in are cute", "but then you decorate them so that is why thought we would decorate and do like a little face", "I like it goes for crows", "all right", "so what maybe I should put on the eyes", "and then you want me to cut a little head out like the little gnome noses little nose ease is that picking up that is really Martin", "oh that should be perfect cool you off to a solid start out", "right I can cut a triangle this is how you bond with your friends guys", "this is how you bond sure over randomly press I want to be more arts and craftsy", "great Sarah is gonna be like no more hanging out with her and which are some crafts", "she is a bad influence on you", "so we are making scarecrow faces we are gluing on eyes and noses", "and then we have puffy paint for the smile", "now you can draw on the eyes or give these to kids", "you know keep an eye on them because the eyes can be popped off easily and those could be a choking hazard", "but you could have a lot of fun with these once they are dry you can add candy or toys to them", "and they make great little gift baskets", "so next we are making burlap inserts for frames that you can already have in your house", "you just replace pictures with these burlap inserts you can do thankful or fall you can do so many different things with it so using stencils and a paint sponge", "you are going to sponge some paint over the stencils so it creates the word of your choice once it dries you can add it to a frame and it will look rustic and really cool", "I liked this idea", "and I loved the idea for thankful as well", "so that is why think I want to do that one and that will last through Thanksgiving so that is why are gonna carve the top of this pumpkin", "take all the guts out", "okay", "I am going to put flowers in here", "so it is gonna be like a little oq", "this wo not last super long", "that is the thing you can get fake pumpkins from like Michael", "is that make sense", "and and I have done that in previous videos", "but you can also do it with a live pumpkin", "so later that night we both took the crafts that we made and decorated our places with them", "and so that is why loved the flowers inside the pumpkin", "I do that every year", "but this is the first year I am doing with a live pumpkin", "make sure you throw it away after two days because it will start to get moldy", "and I love this fall idea", "I might try to do it with like all maroon or just maroon and orange", "but there is so many different ways to do it", "and I decided to put candles instead of flowers because I already had the flowers in the pumpkin", "and then some little pumpkins around", "so I thought that that was a fun centerpiece bright and colorful too", "so my friend Angelique sent me some footage of decorating her centerpiece for her table", "and I loved how she went a totally different direction with her mason jars", "she added flowers and she is decorating it in her own unique way", "I thought it was super cool", "and I wanted to share it with you guys", "so that is why both decorated our house with our DIYs that we made earlier that day so", "a bit later that day I decided to make roasted pumpkin seeds which are good but", "what you need to do is you need to take the inside of the pumpkin", "and you want to clean out the seeds", "so that is why want to remove all of the pumpkin insides so that the seeds are by themselves", "let it dry for about ten to fifteen minutes then spread it evenly on a baking sheet that has olive oil on it and add a little bit of salt", "then you are going to want to pop that in the oven and roast it for about 20 minutes keep your eyes on it because it is going to get golden brown you want to pull them out before they burn so while I am doing that while those are cooking I am going to decorate my front porch so that is", "why have these little lanterns I bought online last year I had fake candles in there this year", "I am just going to stuff it with some smaller pumpkins", "and then I am also going to put seasonal flowers I am gonna have this pumpkin", "I am going to carve this pumpkin in a few weeks", "but for now I am gonna put the pumpkin inside the crate", "I got the crate at Home Depot and", "I also get my seasonal flowers at Home Depot", "so in the summer", "I like lavender in the fall", "I like more fall appropriate colors and trying to make the outside of my house look more welcoming", "and then I take out my traditional decor", "I got this sign last year", "I believe at home it", "and then I am gonna hang my wreath and then that pretty much completes the outside decor", "and then by that point my roasted pumpkin seeds were done so that is why am going to pull them out", "I am going to let them cool down", "and then you can eat them

crafts we went into the kitchen and got a little experimental created some fun crafts including unicorn poop guys and Oliver kept calling it corn poop", "and I was dying", "and it was hilarious", "he had so much fun with all of these", "so I am gonna teach you guys how to make them first one is the DIY glow in the dark bubbles", "so that is why am starting with a half a cup of water and then about a tablespoon of natural dish soap I am using the seventh generation dish soap", "and then you are gonna want some non toxic glow in the dark paint", "and it is optional to also have a green neon non toxic paint as well", "so that is why are gonna put a little bit of each in the bowl", "give it a good mix and place it out in the Sun for about four to five hours so it activates", "the glow in the dark you can store this in an old bubble container and be sure to keep your old bubble ones because of the paint I highly recommend using this outdoors and because of the glow in the dark", "I recommend using it at night", "so it is great for summer nights or vacation nights or any time where it is dark outside", "and you want to bring out the glow in the dark bubbles and have a grand old time next", "I am trying out the DIY fizzy bath dough which I started and divided into two containers I have baking soda a little bit of coconut oil and cream of tartar", "I divided that into two separate containers I added eucalyptus essential oil into each one and then also I am dividing it so that is why can make different colors so that is why am making green and blue which are Oliver is favorite colors", "and then I am gonna mix them up real good till you can see the color thoroughly throughout the mixture", "usually bath bombs or bath dough", "is like this are made with citric acid", "but I am using cream of tartar instead which contains lactic acid which is a little bit more gentle for baby", "is skin so this makes bath time a little bit more fizzy and colorful and fun to play with without adding any color to the skin", "but you could of course choose to omit the food coloring next", "I made a DIY bouncy ball which I will admit the first time I epically failed and I will show you how I did first we are creating a mixture with water and borax next we are creating the mixture for the ball which is basically quarter of a cup of Elmer is glue a little bit of food coloring", "whichever color you like and a little bit of water till it is nice and smooth the way that I did it wrong the first time", "was I added the glue mixture into the borax and water mixture which is the wrong way to do it the best way to do it", "is to add the borax water mixture into the glue so you will see as I do this", "it is kind of flat", "it is not forming into a ball", "and I decided to try it with smaller rubber balls and see if that worked it did not work", "i massively failed", "so I had to do a few attempts to figure this one out", "so once I figured out that you had to add the borax and water mixture into the glue mixture I quickly realized that it formed a ball around my wooden stick", "and so then you want to take your hands and roll it into a ball now", "you are gonna have to do this for a while", "and this was a comp", "I felt like this", "it was not super complicated in the sense that you did not have very many different ingredients", "but I felt like it took a long time for the ball to harden because I as you can see it is not looking like a ball", "so that is why have to sit there and work with it", "you have to continually mold it and manipulate it to create a smooth ball until it is dry", "I made kind of a bigger rubber ball", "so it took a lot longer to harden up and be ready to bounce", "but once it was done it did bounce and we had a fun time with it", "I d say the experiment is pretty fun to try it with your kids but rubber balls are less than a dollar so you could buy one too last but", "certainly not least in fact my favorite is the DIY silly putty in the unicorn poop colors so that is why are doing the same thing we did with the rubber ball which is add some Elmer", "is glue", "then I am gonna color this with pink", "and I am gonna add a little bit of water and get it nice and liquefied and mix together", "and then on the left side", "I have the borax and water mixture", "so that is why are gonna add the borax water into the mixture of glue and that is gonna create a putty instead of manipulating that putty to turn into a rubber ball", "we are gonna keep it and put it into a ziplock bag so that is why can see as I start to pull it up and away from the cup it creates that putty effect", "and that is the chemical reaction that the borax and water mixture has when it touches the Elmer is glue mixture", "so I started with this color", "pretty cool", "huh looks kind of funny", "so that is why am pulling that off the wooden stick I am going to kind of squeeze it together and put it in the ziplock bag", "then I am gonna continue on to make two other colors I am making a kind of like aqua marine blue color which I thought was really pretty", "it is a lighter blue and", "this is all food coloring see how it pulls away like that", "that is pretty cool", "huh", "and then I am gonna make a yellow color so that is why can do it any color that you want any mixture that you want", "but these are kind of lighter more unicorn poop esque colors in my opinion", "and so once that starts to create the putty I am also going to put that in a ziplock bag so on Silpat", "I am gonna take the three different colors", "and I am gonna put them on top of each other and begin to twist the longer you twist the more", "it will start to resemble the rainbow look", "so the first round", "I got a lot more pink", "and so that is why will start to see the more and more I twist it", "the farther", "I go with it", "it becomes more rainbow looking", "and then you twist it around and around until you create unicorn poop which you do not have to do unicorn poop if you do not want to you", "do not have to call it that at first when I heard about unicorn poop", "I was like what in the world who who does that that is so gross", "and then after seeing it over and over again I realized it was hilarious and absolutely so much fun", "and I wanted to try it out for myself", "so that is why did we had a grand old time the thing with this is after a few hours", "it starts to kind of meld together", "all the colors and", "it creates a more like sherbert green color so you can keep the colors separate if you prefer and play with them that way", "but it is basically like a traditional silly putty fun to play with", "hopefully this video was entertaining and gives you some fun ideas for things you can do

snacks today DIY versions of popular snacks that we are all familiar with like Teddy Grahams Cheetos Uncrustables Lunchables things like that I am going to share with you guys what I thought of the final recipes plus show you the recipes so you can try them out for yourself and tell me what you think so", "let is jump right in", "so let is start out with the DIY Teddy Grahams which I will start by saying first and foremost that they do not look exactly or tastes exactly like Teddy Grahams", "but they are close and so that is why am preheating the oven to 350 degrees so the wet ingredients include honey vanilla extract and some melted butter", "I did not have any vanilla extract", "so I used some vanilla bean", "but I will put the recipe including the extract below I am adding some butter", "and then I am going to whisk that up real good", "and then I am going to move into the dry ingredients now for the dry ingredients you are going to want a half a cup of all purpose flour 3 4 of a cup of whole wheat flour some brown sugar a little bit of baking powder and baking soda and a dash of salt", "I also added a 1 2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice", "and then I am going to mix that all together nice and good", "and then I am going to slowly add the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until it creates a dough", "so you are gonna flower a clean surface such as a cutting board", "and I am just going to roll out the dough so unfortunately the smallest bear I could find", "was this cutout", "so it is basically a cookie", "obviously the Teddy Graham manufacturers have a special cutout that they use", "and so it is kind of hard to replicate it exactly", "but we can get pretty close", "so I am cutting out a few of the bears and then you can save the rest of the dough by either freezing it or you can roll it again and create even more bears and I am just going to put that on a medium baking sheet and depending on how hot your oven is you are going to want to cook between 15 to 20 minutes until they get brown", "so um they were very good", "they definitely had a honey flavor to them", "they were not as sweet or as rich as Teddy Grahams", "they were a little bit more light and flaky and crackery", "but I liked them and my son loved him so that was a good attempt for Teddy Grahams that is the closest", "I think I will ever get", "but that is the first recipe that I tried out next we are going to move into the second recipe which is DIY Cheetos when I was researching how to make", "Cheetos", "I realized it was rather complicated", "so I am making a simple version it is a half a cup of all purpose flour one and a half cups of rice flour 1 2 teaspoon of salt four tablespoons of butter cut into about 1 tablespoon size pieces and a half a cup of water so that is going to be the dough that we create", "and then I am going to roll that out and create little as close as I can get Chito shapes as I create them", "I am adding them to a baking sheet", "and I am going to cook them on 350 degrees for about 15 minutes or until golden brown", "I actually took them out a little early the first time so that is why want them to be golden brown but not obviously burnt", "and then you can turn them while they are cooking so that they evenly cook so that is why am taking those out", "and then you are gonna add the cheese powder", "now you want to get the cheese powder from those macaroni and cheese boxes that you get at the store", "and you are gonna put the cheese all over so", "these are more like I would say they are like macaroni and cheese Cheetos", "um this is probably my least favorite recipe out of all of them to be completely honest and the other recipes were so extensive that I realized that Cheetos are actually probably have a lot of junk in them", "they are hard to make so um so those are what the Cheetos turned out to be the next one I am trying", "was the DIY Uncrustables", "so that is why mean everybody knows how to make a PB J", "so there is nothing to learn new here", "but I am using almond butter because my son prefers almond butter over peanut butter", "I do not know", "why but I am making a traditional peanut butter and jelly sandwich", "but with almond butter and", "I have this cutout I got from Bed Bath Beyond and these Uncrustables", "my mom gives them to my son when he is over at her house", "and I am always like mom", "you should make them yourself", "so I do not like to waste this so that is why eat the crust", "but my son does not like the crust", "so you can create these", "and then you can freeze them so that is why can make them ahead of time freeze them", "and then when you want to give your child a peanut butter and jelly sandwich", "or you want it yourself", "you can pull it out of the freezer", "let it defrost and eat it", "and it is a lot less expensive than the Uncrustables", "and you know what is in it", "and you can make your own customized version whether you like almond butter or peanut butter", "so that is why loves those", "and I freeze them ahead of time to make them these are the best", "and I made something kind of similar in my last DIY video", "but this one is even easier so that is why am cutting up strawberries you want to cut them into pretty thin slices", "so that is why am cutting off the green part cutting them into slices putting them on a baking sheet", "and then I am going to cook them for about eight to ten hours on low heat", "so the lowest you can get your oven to go", "and you want to cook them until they completely dehydrate and let me say these are", "so yummy adults and children will love these", "and they mimic the fruit leathers that you can get at the grocery store", "but you do not add anything else", "so I love them as you can see they just peel right off when they are done and they are so good we ate those in like 3 5 seconds", "so next time I think I am going to make a huge batch", "and you can keep them in a ziplock bag to keep them fresh and they will last for a few days but trust me", "I do not think they will actually last for a few days because they are so delicious and super easy", "so I would definitely recommend trying those out next", "I am making some DIY Lunchables and we are mimicking the pizza DIY Lunchables although we are kind of changing it up a little bit so it is a tad bit more healthy I am putting some marinara sauce and these little cups", "some cheese", "and then I am also going to have some flatbread", "these are whole wheat flatbread so they can make like little pizzas and depending on where they go to school", "sometimes you can warm up the bread Oliver is not in school yet but he loves this type of thing", "so that is why thought I would remake the lunchable", "and you can make it a little bit healthier", "so if there is different options like let is say you want to do a non dairy cheese or something you can totally customize it", "and then you can add some applesauce you can find these containers also at Bed Bath Beyond or Target and", "they are great little easy do it yourself Lunchables that you can make for your kids", "so hopefully you guys enjoy

gonna be really great for your skin and your health overall", "I like to make a berry Bowl this will last us a few days I put blueberries raspberries blackberries I have pomegranate seeds and we love to just munch on this in the morning or as a snack I bring it out for Oliver and myself and my husband", "and we all really love it another recipe I like to make", "is chia pudding I have made this before on my channel", "but I am gonna make a variation today that is a little bit different", "I either make it with coconut milk or almond milk today I am making it with almond milk", "this is a vanilla almond beverage that I get at the store", "and today I am going to be adding some chocolate protein powder", "now you can add chocolate powder or cacao powder whatever you have dark chocolate powder if you want I like this because it turns it into a chocolate protein chia pudding which is a little bit different", "so that is why am gonna mix that in with my almond milk", "and then I am gonna add the ratio of chia seeds", "now I am going to have the exact measurements in the description", "because the measurements are pretty important in this case you are going to set this in the refrigerator for about eight hours or overnight and it is going to turn into a pudding consistency", "some people really love this recipe and some people do not love chia pudding", "but I like it", "and I like this variation as well the chocolate chia pudding", "so once it is ready to go after I have refrigerated it overnight", "I am gonna add some berries on top", "and then you have a very antioxidant rich snack you can have it for breakfast", "or you can have it as a snack and", "this is a pretty large bowl so generally about 1 4 or 1 2 of this is plenty to fill me up consuming foods with a lot of fiber", "is great not only for your skin but your overall health and foods that have a lot of fiber are like avocados chia seeds pears berries again black beans and nuts", "so that is why am combining a few of those to make one of my favorite recipes", "I know everybody and their mother loves avocado toast but", "it is basically the easiest thing to make and so delicious", "I have sprouted toasts that I toast up in the toaster", "I add a little avocado some chia seeds a little bit of lemon some arugula on top and a little bit more lemon", "and I love to have this with some tea", "so that is why are moving into anti inflammatory foods now", "and I am going to make a few different teas with these anti inflammatory ingredients so these are a few ingredients that are anti inflammatory", "but I am gonna make some green tea I have been loving these kind of dried herbs right now around the house", "and I have some leftover green tea", "I have some minced ginger and", "I am going to add this to some boiling hot water with some raw honey if you prefer you can definitely omit the honey and this can be consumed hot or cold", "it is very good", "and I am gonna have it in combination with my avocado toast so the tea in the oven Otto toast together make a yummy and healthy snack so that is something I like to have next we are going to be making another type of tea", "and this is a tumeric tea tumeric definitely has a very specific flavor that you may or may not like", "I like it", "and it is just a little bit of the tumeric with some raw honey and minced ginger", "so the next thing you want to think about is consuming some type of probiotic", "you can find probiotics in so many different ways but they are great for your overall health and in turn they are also really great for your skin so that is why like these by ok shots this one is a dairy free one it tastes good", "it tastes like mango", "and I take that every day also consuming foods that contain lots of minerals", "nuts", "seeds", "I like pumpkin seeds this time of year", "they are high in rich in minerals so that is why am eating some pumpkin seeds also omega 3s and greens so like a salmon and kale together or broccoli", "you can find omega 3s with salmon chia seeds and flax seeds for dinner", "I like to kind of mix these together", "so that is why brought Byron on to my channel to help me cook a dinner we are doing some olive oil he is chopping up some onion we are going to add that to stovetop with a little bit of thyme and some garlic so that is why am gonna add some red chili flakes and some white beans which again white beans are really excellent source of fiber they are really good for you", "so that is why am adding that in there and I am gonna let this cook for about 30 to 45 minutes", "and then I am going to add some kale in there and a little bit", "and this is a recipe my husband used to make at one of the restaurants he worked at", "and I always really loved it", "it is really delicious", "so if you are into these types of foods even if you do not want to eat the salmon you can make the the white beans and this is", "it is almost like a white bean stew", "it is really good", "so some nights I cook some nights he cooks and", "some nights we like to cook together", "and it is kind of like a team tag team situation", "so that is why am chopping up the red onion and the parsley this is going to be added to the white beans after they have cooked a little bit he is gonna do these Salmons so that is why is adding some olive oil here on a hot pan", "we are gonna sear it", "so that is why have wild Alaskan salmon here if you do not eat meat you can definitely do a tofu steak if you prefer", "but the salmon is rich in omega 3 fatty acids which are great for your skin", "we are adding some rosemary some garlic", "and then we are going to go ahead and sear that on both sides", "so the ingredients that I chopped up are going to go in the pan that contains the white beans that have been cooking up", "we are also going to rip some kale and put that in there as well", "stir it together nicely", "and then the way that I like to plate this is", "I mean this by itself is so delicious", "the white bean mixture with the kale is really good", "it is very flavorful and the way that I like to plate this", "is", "I usually have a bowl", "and I put the white bean into the bowl and then put the salmon on top of it I am going to sprinkle a little bit of rosemary on top garnish it", "and this is so so delicious so if you eat fish and or even if you do not you could just have the white beans by themselves", "but if you eat fish this is so good and the omega 3 fatty acids are great for your skin the kale is good for you too and", "your entire body", "so

first I am going to share with you some daily tips that you can incorporate into your routine that will make a huge difference in your skin over time", "so the first one is to create a skincare routine in the morning so a lot of dermatologists and skin care specialists recommend cleansing your skin twice a day because generally when you wake up in the morning you kind of you have slept and you have slept off some dead skin cells and your skin definitely needs to be cleansed and refreshed so I am using the Clarisonic to clean my skin sometimes I will use this in the morning sometimes at night kind of depends", "but I do not use it every single day usually twice a week or three times a week", "I also like to use a vitamin C serum or a moisturizer and the reason why is because vitamin C is an antioxidant", "it is a rich antioxidant that is great for your skin", "this has a liquid on it", "and I am applying this on my face", "I always take my products down my neck across my chest

clean your phone we happen to be using our phones a lot right next to our face and sometimes the phone can carry bacteria that can actually cause breakouts and it is not good for your skin", "so that is why like to use my all natural wipes their disinfectant wipes to disinfect my phone", "I also recommend cleaning your makeup brushes once a week another thing that I am not that great at doing",

can cause breakouts so once you have given your brushes a bath", "I also recommend cleaning your sheets once a week and your pillowcases can be cleaned twice a week if needed if you feel like you might be breaking out", "more than usual your pillowcases can harbor bacteria there is all sorts of things that go down at night when you sleep like drooling and dead skin cells and all that jazz so

cleaning up the kitchen today cleaning the kitchen", "is very exciting it is actually not very exciting", "but we are going to make it more exciting because we are going to be making some DIY so that is why are starting with this surface spray that I like to use it", "is equal parts water and vinegar which vinegar is used a lot for cleaning", "and then I am going to use some essential oil I am actually using orange lemon", "can be a little harsh on countertops so that is why would keep that in mind", "but I am using that with bar towels which these are bar towels right here", "I get these on Amazon", "I d buy them in bulk", "they are really great", "my husband loves them in the kitchen", "and I like them too", "so once or twice a week I will move everything and clean the counters but every day I like to wipe down my counters and", "this is what I use to do that", "so next we are making a DIY floor cleanser the floors in my kitchen gets so disgusting", "and I think it is just everybody is walking through there", "and they have to be cleaned a lot", "so that is why have hot water I am using some kitchen soap some baking soda and vinegar which again vinegar is used in a lot of these recipes and you want to make a fresh batch every time you are going to clean your floors this works great for tile floors which is what I have", "and then I have a double sided mop I am just going to take this solution pour a little bit on my floor and then go ahead and mop with the side that is supposed to be damp", "and I am going to try to do it as all I would say twice three times a week I mean every night ideally if possible because the floors get so gross", "but I do not always get to it every single night", "so that is why am going to go ahead and clean the floors", "and I am gonna whistle", "while I work to do all right floors check now we are moving on to a DIY refrigerator deodorizer in my next video", "i am going to be cleaning out my refrigerator and my pantry which definitely needed help", "and i wanted to share that with you guys", "but i also wanted to make a deodorizer for the refrigerator", "this is easy it is just baking soda and lemon essential oil", "it smells super yummy and it also makes your refrigerator smell good", "it absorbs any nasty sense so that is why would highly recommend putting this in your refrigerator", "I like to keep it in a place where it is not noticeable", "so I put it on the side door and it works fabulous", "so I have done another household cleaning video", "I think I have done a few and this is something I did in the microwave", "but you can also do it in the dishwasher", "so I am putting a large mug in the dishwasher and filling it up with vinegar", "and then I am running the dishwasher I am your stereotypical wash that you would normally do", "and it is going to clean out the inside of your dishwasher", "you can also wipe it down with one of those bar towels when the load is finished", "so next we are moving on to cleaning cutting boards which I did a little research", "I d love to hear if any of you guys have great tips for cleaning cutting boards but ours were getting kind of gross", "so that is why basically took some coarse salt and some lemon", "and I am gonna scrub it with that because we cook on these", "so often it smells like garlic or whatever it is that we are cooking on so it is important to clean these thoroughly as often as you can if you have these and take good care of them because they are an investment they are great for cooking", "but you want to really maintain them", "so the coarse salt and the lemon is going to help basically clean them and get any stains and any smells off", "you can also use a traditional brush they have brushes that they sell specifically for cleaning cutting boards", "but you can take some dish soap and wash it", "so that is why if you want but I do like the lemon and coarse salt tip that is a great tip also", "the next thing to keep in mind is if it is a warm sunny day you can let these dry outside and that is also another great way to sanitize them by keeping them out in the so", "I am setting out a towel", "and then I am going to place them out in the Sun and let them dry so in order to refresh your board and keep it looking really nice", "you normally people will use mineral oil traditionally but it is better for the environment to use coconut oil so that is what I am doing", "I have a damp cloth one of my bar towels I am adding a little bit of oil I would say about maybe", "a little less than a tablespoon", "and I am making sure to cover both sides", "and it refreshes and revives your cutting boards", "so definitely try out those tips you can also do the same thing with wooden spoon so you can revitalize them with a little bit of coconut oil by rubbing it with a damp cloth into the wooden spoons", "so next I want to show you guys what I use in terms of sponges", "there is a few different options it is all very exciting", "can I say this one is for pans specifically and I use gloves", "but these are miracle workers on pans and then also these are great for when you just have", "it is you have got something really stuck on a pan these work great", "but you want to you are vigilant about cleaning them", "these are great", "these are natural sponges you can see I find these generally at natural food stores and the great thing about those", "is you add a little bit of water", "and they expand", "so it is nice when you buy them that comes in that small little package", "and then the sponges expand when you add water", "you can also cut them in half to save which I like that tip because they are big sponges so you definitely cutting them in half is a great idea and when it comes to cleaning sponges a lot of people throw them in the dishwasher", "and I too have done that in the past", "but I would highly recommend throwing them into a mesh bag", "you can find mesh bags at Target Bed Bath Beyond", "I highly recommend having three or four around the house they are great for traveling and things like this throwing sponges in you", "can add it to a towel load or a load that is hot because I do like to wash it in hot", "and then you can dry it as well", "and then next going back to the kitchen for the sponges those can get gross so throw them boiling hot water", "I have this water right", "it is boiling hot water", "usually they have a lot of gunk on them", "but I just decided for this video", "I wo not make it too gross", "so you can put that in there", "and it will all kind of release from the sponges you give it a nice good cleanse with some dish soap and put it back on your dish container or holder", "and I like to have two different containers or holders for my sponges and also these rougher sponges next", "we are doing an end of day cleanser", "so at the very end of the day you add some baking soda with some essential oils", "so the same mixture we made for the refrigerator deodorizer", "so that is why can actually make a double batch if you want to", "again this smells good and we are going to mix that together pour that in the sink and then directly on top of that we are going to put just the traditional dish soap", "so these are pretty easy ingredients I have these nice big gloves I always use these for cleaning and doing the dishes and all that stuff so that my hands can stay a little bit nicer so that is why am going to really give it a nice good scrub down and ideally do this every single night if you do this", "every single night your kitchen sink will look super shiny so", "this is what I do", "like I said I do not get around to it every single night", "but it is a great cleanser for the end of the night", "so that is why would highly recommend doing that", "oh can you see my little caterpillar and his chrysalis in the background", "he is like a little green guy in that plant and he is going to hatch any day", "now I am so excited", "and I get to see him every day when I clean", "so I mean who would not be excited to clean if they saw a beautiful little caterpillar right there and his chrysalis", "so anyway I am wiping

good beverage so that is why would highly recommend making it now since I used coconut sugar instead of traditional granulated sugar", "my mixture", "my simple syrup is a lot darker", "so it is a very", "it almost looks like a tea", "the option that you could do is add food coloring some violet food coloring or natural food coloring", "and it will really look like a lavender lemonade", "but if

good", "these are great for if you are sick or if someone in your family is sick so that is why last a long time and they are a great recipe", "so try not let me know what you think next we are going to make a blend of herbs for an herbal facial steam so that is why have an apothecary container I am adding some lavender chamomile and rosebuds", "this is a great gift so if you are going to use it as a gift I would definitely recommend putting a label on it and putting a pretty bow and giving it as a gift", "I remember the first time I experimented with herbal facial steams they started selling them at Bath Body Works when I was young", "and I bought it", "and that is when I got into facial steams", "facial steams are often used at spas before a mask is applied to the skin you can make an at home facial steam really easy with dried herbs like these mixed together and a bowl of boiling hot water", "and you put your face right above it for more of a steaming effect", "you can put a towel over your head and it is going to prep your skin for a mask", "so next we are going to be making some rose water to make a rose water spray that we can spritz on our skin or our body", "it is very refreshing all you need", "is some red rose petals I am picking those fresh off of these roses and I am adding that to a small saucepan", "and then I am going to add some water", "bring it to a boil and then allow it to simmer for about 20 to 30 minutes until it becomes pink it is the most beautiful color and", "it is going to absorb all the color into the water from the petals and the petals will start to become more pale less red and turn very like almost pinkish purple so it is really pretty to watch so rose water can be used for a lot of DIYs", "and I am actually going to be saving the rest of this", "it is a concentrate I am going to keep it in the refrigerator I am going to make a gel out of it for the next video that is going up on Monday", "so that is why am going to keep a little bit of this so basically I am going to strain it into one of these containers", "I am gonna seal it and stick it in the refrigerator next", "I have a glass container it is filled with distilled water with a little bit of space for this rose water concentrate", "and then it makes a great facial or body spray", "so that is why could also keep it in the refrigerator for a nice cooling effect

the smallest I could find", "and you want to find small ones so that the melts fit in your mouth", "so hey we have aliens and planets here", "and then I am adding the peppermint oil one drop into each little mold then you are going to stick that in the refrigerator so that the coconut oil has a chance to harden", "and it creates these melts that need to be kept in the refrigerator", "but when they are put in your mouth the natural temperature of your body melts it", "and then you are left with oil", "and you are going to swish that around in your mouth", "and it is basically a natural mouthwash

are all stinky at time", "so these can definitely come in handy so that is why am going to jump right in", "so the kitchen can sometimes smell gross especially after dinnertime so these disposal refresher cubes are amazing and they are easy to make now you can certainly chop up some lemon and throw it down the disposal and that does the trick", "but I love this hack because it is relatively easy to make super fast", "and it takes it up another notch for sure in making your kitchen area smell nice particularly the sink so that is why have one lemon here in one lime", "and I am chopping it up into little small bits", "and then I have an ice cube tray I am going to put those bits evenly throughout the ice cube tray", "and then I have vinegar I am going to go ahead and pour the vinegar over that and freeze it you after about six to eight hours they will be frozen solid and you can take one or two after you have done a load of dishes and throw it down the disposal you can turn on the disposal with a little bit of water running and it does have a nice aromatic smell that comes up from the disposal and", "so instead of it smelling like dinner it smells really nice and clean those

I have a little bit of mint I am going to add some vanilla extract", "then you are going to add boiling hot water over that", "and you are going to let it basically kind of simmer", "and that is going to create a nice smell", "now it is much stronger again if you use all these ingredients put it in a pot and let it simmer on low", "but you really have to keep an eye on it because once the water

how I have done it with those if you do not have space to display your shoes or you just do not care to display your shoes", "you can certainly put them in plastic bins so you can put your shoes in

got at HomeGoods you can get these for anywhere from 7 to 15 dollars I am going to take some tape basically in tape off an area so that the paint does not get in that area", "so it is like half and half", "so that is what I am going to do with the first face the second phase I am just going to paint it completely", "and then the metallic spray you can also get for about 10 to 12 bucks and that

exfoliant if your skin is really sensitive", "you want to go for a really light chemical exfoliant such as lactic acid if your skin can handle it", "this is a great physical scrub and you d want to try to go in small circular motions", "I am probably going a little intense there", "but I like to get a good scrub in", "but you want to you start with that first step of exfoliating when trying to diminish acne scars and be sure to use a towel that you are not concerned about staining because tumeric does tend to stain it does not stain my skin", "but it does stay in my towels so keep that in mind the next thing is to treat with an acne scarring mask you can find those at stores", "but you can also make it basically I am making some oatmeal with cinnamon oatmeal and lemon now if you have sensitive skin or you are sensitive to cinnamon you want to just patch test this on the side of your cheek first before using it all over your face", "and if it were me I d probably put this through the food processor and not put it directly on my face as is because I do not love the texture and it was kind of messy", "but I did love this mask", "and I saw amazing brightening results", "and it made my skin feel super soft so that is why would definitely try that the next thing is to protect your skin and just heal the scarring now if you have current breakouts I would not recommend this", "but if your healing scars kind of older scars this is almond oil you have some lemon essential oil", "and then you can use either sandalwood or frankincense", "now both these oils are some of the more expensive essential oils but the gray thing is you use a few drops and they last a long time they have a lot of benefits you can make tons and tons of products with it", "and then with this particular thing I am putting it on the acne scars", "so it lasts a very very long time", "so it is very effective", "and I would definitely recommend trying that out the next thing is brightening treatments a lot of you asked me about brightening elbows knees and under your arms so these are the treatments that I came up with for brightening those areas first again you always want to exfoliate", "so that is why are making a DIY exfoliating scrub I am starting with some coconut oil and some sugar", "and then I am adding some lemon essential oil you can also add lemon if you do not have the essential oil you want to try for at least once a week", "and then you can work up to twice a week if you are concerned with discoloration", "but you are basically just going to give a nice exfoliation to your knees and your elbows now", "I will say even if you are not concerned with discoloration this really does help with rough elbows and knees", "so I would highly recommend it and", "the next we are going to make a DIY mask or treatment for your knees and elbows", "now I feel like I have made a mask for everything on my channel", "but hey why not this mask is also very natural and you could probably eat it with chips and it would be delicious because it is a full avocado a half a cucumber and some lemon", "and I am going to mix that in a blender and create a very brightening treatment mask for your knees and elbows now", "I did a video a while back for your hands and feet", "and I made a mask kind of similar with the same technique for calluses on the bottom of your feet", "but for here this is a different mask", "and we are doing the same thing by putting saran wrap over it and kind of tying it into a knot I would recommend doing this like at night or", "whenever you have a free time and you could sit and watch a movie and like look like a crazy person because anybody who sees you is gonna be like what the heck are you doing", "and then after that you want to put on this body butter", "this is an amazing recipe I love it", "it is shea butter aloe vera vitamin E almond oil", "there is a little bit of glycerin in there and some rice powder I will put all the ingredients below", "so that is why can get it", "but I am whipping this up if you have a hand mixer that works too and", "if you have a strong arm you can whisk it by hand", "Byron is always whisking things by hand", "but for me it takes so long that I end up using our mixer and this creates a fluffy body cream or body butter", "that is nice also really great for sunburns because of the aloe vera and the vitamin E it also smelled incredible because of the almond oil and Byron", "kept asking like what is that what what is on you you smell so good", "and it was this lotion", "so that is why would really recommend trying this out if you have some time", "and you can get the ingredients it was a nice body cream so last but not least we are going to tackle bruises and scarring which is actually hard scars", "are particularly hard but I am going to make a DIY scar healing mask I am using this clay that I have used in many of my videos", "recently you can make face masks", "but you can also make this healing scar mask", "I am adding some vitamin E oil", "I get this little jar of vitamin E oil for pretty affordable at Trader Joe", "is", "and then I am adding my lavender oil now when treating scars or even stretch marks it is important to remember that it is best to treat him right away when they are fresh I have some old school scars I have one on my knee that I got in high school", "I was so embarrassed about it for so many years", "but then I got over it as I got older", "I have a scar also on my chin from when I tripped and fell in kindergarten", "I split my chin open", "so that is why can use this on acne scars or any scars older new", "and you want to use it as a mask maybe once twice three times a week for 20 30 minutes if you can keep it on so for bruising if you take a washcloth and put it under warm water add a little bit of vinegar and tap it into a bruise", "it is effective and kind of bringing blood flow and helping the bruise go away faster", "I usually have bruises everywhere because I bruise like a peach", "but I had this small one and", "then a homeopathic option is Arnica Montana which also comes in a cream form or you can use these little tablets under your tongue these are really effective for minimizing bruising", "and you can do some research about it", "but it is always worked for me", "I highly recommend it and you can find them pretty easily at your local vitamin store", "so thanks so much for watching my channel", "hopefully these tips gave you some ideas check out my last two videos and my other channel and

way", "so first and foremost when packing for a cruise there are a few things to keep in mind because it is a little bit different than packing for a traditional trip I definitely recommend before going on a cruise or any trip for that matter to check the weather of the destination for a cruise specifically you want to keep in mind that you are gonna be on open water", "a lot so that is why want to pack lots of layers", "some days it is warm", "it is even hot enough to hit the pool some days", "it is cold", "some days it is rainy so that is why want to keep that all in mind when packing on the cruise ship", "there are lots of very fine dining restaurants with dress codes so I did pack two dresses", "I packed rain boots especially if you are going on an Alaskan cruise", "I would recommend rain boots and warm boots a few extra things you can bring our waterproof socks or Poncho is which are definitely things you can find on the ship and when you port", "but it is nice to have it with you ahead of time", "there are not a ton of plugs on the ship definitely enough for traditional electronics but if you are bringing cameras or computers that you need to charge I brought a extension cord and expandable duffel for the days that you port so that is why can throw whatever you need in there and then close it up and then that pretty much completed all my packing obviously my toiletries and all that other stuff I usually set out my outfit the night before", "so if I wake up early in the morning for a flight I am not trying to find an outfit it is already kind of packed and ready to go", "we have been traveling a lot with Oliver and it can be challenging", "but I think preparation is key", "I found that that works best for me so again with him the same as with the adults packing lots of different layers you can pick up diapers when you port", "but I brought enough for the entire trip", "and I did pack some rain boots and a towel a hat for the warmer days a bathing suit a flashlight", "and I also found binoculars we had a two hour flight to Seattle which is where we got on the ship", "so I definitely have", "my favorite snacks for Oliver snacks make him very happy so it is very important that I am fully stocked with snacks", "I always pack a first aid kit too and", "I feel like it is always helpful to have sunscreen spray gentle sunscreen for the face

"but we all felt great", "and they actually sell most of these items on the ship", "and they have a medical center in case you are not feeling very well", "so there are lots of resources when going on a cruise especially your first one I would definitely recommend checking out the website you can also book appointments at the spa or the fitness center you can print out", "your boarding passes there is a lot of things that you can do on the app and on the website it is a great resource to educate yourself on all the different excursions and options and things you can do on days that you port and just kind of what to expect so", "that is why definitely did that I did print out", "my boarding passes ahead of time", "and I usually try to take all my documents including my passports and all identification", "and I try to put them in a folder whenever I travel", "otherwise I will lose it like I will lose it for sure", "so next along with everything I need for my toddler", "I always bring

some of the chemicals that are used when you go get your car wash", "all right", "so that is why am gonna start in the trunk of my car which was a disaster zone lots of toys and towels and sand we had been hitting up the beach a lot", "so I took out the mat", "and I shook it out", "then I took my vacuum", "and I used a little extension to get out all the sand and completely vacuum down the back of the trunk", "I hate I love the beach", "but I hate the sand that you bring home after the beach so that is why also took the mat and put it back in and continue to do it one more time", "so that is why got it nice and clean", "so next", "I am gonna be using the all purpose cleaner that I made previously with a damp cloth", "and I am just gonna rub down the mat to give it", "kind of that clean

add there is lots of cups and from going on road trips and Disneyland and the beach this summer lots of receipts ended up kind of everywhere receipts and parking passes and little knickknacks that I

gonna put a few things in my center console that I like to have in my car including some body lotion", "a few tampons pens some cash for parking or if you need it last minute it is good to always kind

my channel", "so today we are making some fun DIY skincare you can either use this for yourself or use it as gifts for friends or family or whoever you think would love it", "but I am going a little bit above and beyond for these making some fun DIY skin care including cupcake bath bombs", "some color blocks", "so", "and we are also making cotton candy flavored lip scrub", "so let is jump right in", "okay", "so let is start with a cupcake bath bombs we are starting with dry ingredients", "and then we are going to slowly incorporate wet ingredients", "so we have about 8 ounces of baking soda some citric acid cornstarch and Epsom salts and love your little plate lemonade next", "we have the wet ingredients", "so that is why have some coconut oil we are going to add some vanilla extract and in this case we are adding a little bit of food coloring to make them pop a little bit more", "so I have made DIY bath bombs on my channel before and basically the recipe is the same you do not have to add food coloring if you do not like it", "but I thought for a gift it might be kind of fun to add some red to make it pink so that is what I am doing here", "but if you prefer not to have food coloring you can omit that so basically I am adding the wet into the dry slowly so that it does not fizz you want to keep that for the fizzing action for once you drop it into the bath so that is why want to", "you add the wet ingredients very slowly", "and then I am going to press this into cupcake molds", "you can make any type of DIY bath bomb you want if you have Starr molds or circle molds or", "whatever you have in this case I am making kind of faux cupcakes so that is why am going to press that into the cupcake pan", "so next we have the frosting", "now I originally put this video up with a traditional frosting", "but I wanted to", "it was not confusing that if you make a traditional frosting like this with meringue powder and powdered sugar and vanilla that is going to need to be removed", "and it is pretty easy to remove off the top of the bath bomb before putting it in the water", "but you could always replace the sugar with shea butter and add that to the bath after it is done whipping I am going to add it into a piping bag", "and I am going to go ahead and pipe", "the frosting on top of the bath bombs be sure to keep in mind that these do look a lot like cupcakes so if you have young children you want to keep them out of reach", "I know my son definitely thought that they were real cupcakes", "I am sure they taste nothing like real cupcakes", "but we would never want to find that out", "so keep them out of reach and wrapped up", "I have made soap before on my channel", "so I already had the glycerin soap in my craft cabinet", "so basically all you are going to do is you are going to take the clear soap", "and you are going to melt it in the microwave for about 20 to 30 seconds", "and you are going to do small portions and add different colors of food coloring", "so that is why am going to start first by melting it", "and then I am going to add the first color which is a few drops of red which is going to basically give it a kind of rosy pink appearance I am also going to add a little bit of purple into that mixture as well so that it has more of like a maroon pinky look to it", "you can add your favorite scent of essential oil by adding a few drops", "and then I am taking the soap molds and as you can see I angled the soap mold so that when I pour the liquid into it it comes out slanted so that is why am doing the first side which is pink", "then I am going to do the second portion of the soap which is going to be purple", "the liquid soap dries pretty fast but you do want to the first round", "is dry before you pour the next color on and again it is going to be slanted next", "we have the final color which I chose to be teal again", "I am going to make sure it is completely dry", "and then I am going to pour the final layer on top and let that dry", "and then you are going to have a nice color block soap that you can also wrap in cellophane and give away as a gift or add with another gift", "it is a nice little homemade touch and you can customize it so last but certainly not least", "we are making DIY flavored cotton candy lip scrub so that is why am starting out with three different containers with the same amount of granulated sugar", "and then I am adding some olive oil as a tip", "this is great all on its own as a lip scrub", "but we are going to make it a little bit more fun since this is a gift", "and we are going to be adding some different elements to it", "so the middle is going to stay white and the two sides are going to be pink and purple but first I am adding cotton candy flavoring to it which I found on Amazon you can add pink to the one side and then purple to the other side", "and you want to slowly incorporate them together", "you want to", "the colors do not bleed too much together so that is why want to be slow when you are mixing it", "so that is why it will have a combination of the colors again if you do not like food coloring feel free to omit this and make this on its own", "but this is a fun way to make it a little bit more interesting you are going to want a glass jar to store this in", "and it will last you about a month", "so I would recommend you know maybe giving this to someone with a sweet note or adding it to another gift", "it is fun add ons for friends or", "family something that you made on your own", "so that is why wanted to share these with you guys", "I am also taking requests for new videos right now", "so please be sure to leave requests for the videos you want to see I am going to do a Q A video soon so if you have any

loaded with lots of different things so first we are starting with the arugula", "I just love the flavor of arugula", "I am a huge fan of it", "I have this instant quinoa that you can certainly cook yourself on the stove", "but I like these because you cook them in the microwave for a minute", "it is probably better to cook it on the stove", "but if you are in a rush I am putting a little bit of zucchini and cucumber", "and then I am adding some tomatoes sliced tomatoes radishes a little bit of basil you", "I am a huge fan of sun dried tomatoes", "I know they are not for everyone", "but if you like them you can add those some artichoke hearts salt and pepper little olive oil and vinegar", "and I am gonna mix it together", "I did add some red pepper flakes to kind of make it a little bit spicy because I love spicy and you can eat it in the bowl or you can plate it on a plate with a little bit of hummus you can add some feta cheese and avocado to make it like a Greek style", "salad", "it depends on how you want to do it", "I loved it with the hummus", "it tasted super yummy and delicious", "and I think out of all three of the salads this one is definitely my favorite you can add or take away anything that you do not like", "but this salad is definitely a winner for my second salad recipe", "we have the fully raw spicy Thai salad", "super delicious we are going to start with the sauce so that is why am adding some lime juice which it is a little easier to use lime juice like this as opposed to squeezing limes which you could do fresh lime adjust depending on the lime so it can take a long time to get the amount that you need", "but you can definitely do that some sriracha", "so Rochester is that how you pronounce it Sorachi sriracha I am adding that a little bit in that in there", "and then you can add peanut butter if you want", "but I am using almond butter", "I will have the exact measurements listed below a little bit of garlic a little bit of ginger some salt and pepper", "and I am going to give that a mix at first I was not sure how this was gonna taste", "but it tasted bomb I loved it", "so now we are gonna make the actual salad I am doing a terrible job grating the zucchini", "but basically I am grating the zucchini to create noodles if you will not doing the best job doing it", "I could probably use Byron", "is help", "but hey this is what I came up with and it tasted fine so that is all that matters some chopped red cabbage I am going to add some snap peas a little bit of cilantro", "I am gonna add some broccoli some raw broccoli I am going to cut up some onions and add them in there too green onion I have some carrots which you again you could do freshly grated carrots", "but I had these in my refrigerator so that is why am adding this all together", "and then you are going to go ahead and add your sauce on top of it", "and it was amazing", "I loved this salad for sure", "so that is why would definitely recommend this if you are into these types of flavors and you think that this would be something you would enjoy definitely try it out so last", "but not least we have a salad that can also be a salsa you can eat it by itself", "or you can use it to pair with something else", "so that is why am using the stovetop grill to grill up some corn and some red bell peppers basically until they are a little bit Brown blackish after those have had a chance to grill up a bit I am going to chop them up", "and I am going to take a knife to get the corn off the cob I am going to throw that into a bowl I am going to add some black beans I am going to add some red onion some cilantro and a little bit of salt and pepper if you are a fan of the Chipotle corn salsa", "you are going to love this because it is like a dupe of that", "I am adding a little bit of olive oil some lime juice", "and then I am going to make a little aioli sauce that you can use with this salad", "so that is why am going to mix everything in there", "and then on the side I have some yogurt I have some cumin and some cayenne pepper", "I am going to mix that all together to make this aioli and then again you can serve the salad by itself with a little bit of the aioli on the side", "you can also add this with tacos with a burrito", "um you know basically anything that you feel like this would go well with", "it was delicious", "I ate it by itself you can add a little feta cheese on top of it if you want and that completes these super easy DIY salads that I love", "hopefully you will try one of them out and", "you will like them",

every few months", "and I am going to share with you my tips on how I do it and my strategy if you will so let is jump right in", "so my first tip is to clean and declutter so first and foremost", "do your normal cleaning routine which for me is dishes and laundry and all the kind of normal picking up that I do anyway around the house", "so that is why am going to start with the kitchen", "and I am going to start with just doing the dishes and getting those all cleaned up and putting those away", "and then I am going to go through each room and declutter and by decluttering", "I basically mean I am going to purge I am going to go through all the cabinets in my kitchen", "you can get rid of old pots and pans things that you do not want but also", "your pantry checking for expiration dates seeing what is good", "what is not good", "I also like to take my dried goods and put them in sealed containers", "makes it easier for me to find everything", "and I go through all these products quick", "so it helps that I do not waste", "or I do not buy something I do not need", "so that is why do use these airtight containers", "and then I will put whatever is leftover in the pantry just get it all nice and organized and then that will complete the kitchen", "then I will move on to my closet", "I like to purge clothes if I have not worn and I pretty much reassess every six months if I have worn something or if I think I want to give it away", "you can donate", "but you can also sell on various apps so like if I am getting rid of some accessories that I do not want to donate", "but I d rather sell", "I will sell my items at my Poshmark store which there are different stores online like eBay or whatever that you can sell your items and you know find it a new home", "so maybe you do not want to donate it", "but you want to sell it instead", "so that is definitely one thing I will do", "and I also look at how crazy cluttered my skincare drawer is again", "I will go through and look at expiration dates a tip with skincare", "is look on the back and you will see it looks like an open jar", "and it will say nine months or twelve months and", "that is how long after you open it that it stays good", "so if it is been in there longer than that you definitely need to toss it", "so that is why go through my drawers my cabinets and just get rid of anything that is expired or that is old and gross", "and then I do the same thing with my son", "is toys", "I donate whatever he is not using or playing with on the regular", "he has a toy chest", "but it seems like he keeps getting more books and toys from grandparents and", "so basically I get these drawer containers from Target and he knows now to kind of put things away in his drawer when it is cleanup time", "and they are great for keeping things organized next", "I am going to go through the house and dust which my house gets really really dusty very fast so on the floors and for dusting I use Swiffer and I am using

free and gentle for the last few years", "and it also has the high efficiency seal so that is why can use it with your high efficiency washer which has basically different needs so for smaller loads

blankets or my bedding", "I will use two of the Tide Pods and basically they dissolve in any temperature of water", "and it has the perfect amount in there for your load of laundry", "so my biggest loads are the towels and all of my bedding", "I have a duvet cover", "so it is not as big as it could be if it was a full size blanket or something like that", "but it definitely still takes up a lot of space I am sure everybody is laundry routine is a little bit different", "but I start with piles", "and I put the piles in laundry basket", "and then I bring those into the laundry room", "and I start with my largest pile first and the dry and fold and put that away", "and then I go to the smallest", "and", "I also do child safety lock where ever cleaning supplies are because he is at that age where he is kind of curious so that completes all of the laundry definitely something that takes a long time but is important to get done and then next I clean the floors", "so I vacuum the

days if you want to you", "do not have to do it all in one day", "but I try to mop the entire house next", "it is time to wipe down all the hard surfaces and you can make DIY cleaners I have done a few of them on my channel before", "but we are going to make a really easy one today using borax so that is why am using a tablespoon of borax a tablespoon of natural soap I am going to add some vinegar and then some water", "and that is a wall cleaner", "so this is great for hard surfaces like the wall and my son is not in phase where he is still learning that coloring on the wall is a no no", "and we have lots of two year old handprints all over and", "this works really great for dirty walls", "I used it on an area where he colored", "and it came off pretty easy which I was ecstatic

are very easy to find for the most part so hopefully these will be easy for you guys to try out", "and we are going to start with the first one which is a do it yourself clay mask", "then tonight clay you can find I found mine at sprouts for about 5 4 or 5 dollars for this entire container", "and so you are going to do a few tablespoons", "and then you are going to add apple cider vinegar that is going to create a reaction you will see it will bubble", "it is optional to add a drop or two of lavender oil you do not have to do that if you do not want to these two ingredients together make a very effective face mask", "and it is very common with this healing clay", "that after you use it you experience a little bit of redness at first was a little worried about it", "but then I read on the instructions that that is actually part of the process", "and it is okay", "and it will diminish", "so it did", "and it did clean out my pores and made my skin look all my pores look tight so that is why like this because you can make a fresh face mask every time you want to do a clay face mask", "and this reminds me of a dupe of the glam glow mask", "actually I think it is as effective it will kind of tighten up a little bit", "and then you are just going to take it off with a warm washcloth", "so now if you have dry skin this is a mask for you and this mask can also work for your hair so it is a half of an avocado and half of a banana you are going to smash those two together and then add some olive oil you can add some essential oil if you want I am again adding a little bit of lavender essential oil", "and you can put this in your hair on your face", "it is great for hydrating your hair and your skin so if you experience dry skin this is definitely the mask for you", "this next mask is an anti aging retinol spinach facial mask spinach is an incredible beneficial green leafy vegetable", "it is a source of vitamin C vitamin E beta carotene and several other nutrients that revitalize the skin so in addition to spinach containing retinol", "it has other very effective ingredients for your skin so that is why are using spinach", "leaves pure honey extra virgin olive oil and a little bit of lemon juice you can put them in any type of blender or food processor you have", "just until it is completely blended and then apply that on your skin next we have a mask for combination skin but", "this mask is also incredibly brightening that is because we have a powerful ingredient tumeric which is fantastic for your skin so that is why have 1 4 teaspoon of turmeric powder 1 tablespoon of honey 1 4 cup of plain yogurt", "and you can add optionally 2 tablespoons of flour to thicken it", "I personally did not need that", "but you do want to be careful with the tumeric because it can stain your clothes so that is why would recommend wearing a robe or a dark shirt", "when applying this mask in case you drop some", "but I loved the effect of this mask", "this is definitely one I will make over and over again because I did notice instant brightening after using it", "so I would definitely recommend trying this out", "all of these masks are relatively

28th", "so it is the perfect time to test out you know new goodies or stock up on old favorites and they are going to be having daily beauty steals that are 50 off", "so all the products that I am using in this video are available at Ulta beauty and I am starting with shampoo and conditioner because that is the first step to getting these beachy waves I picked up the coconut water shampoo and conditioner", "I actually currently use the body wash from this brand", "I love the smell it has", "that Pina Colada smell perfect for summer", "next you are going to want to use a texturizing spray", "they have a lot of different salt sprays and like beachy hair sprays", "so that is why am starting with the wet brush and", "I am using that it is usually never ideal to brush your hair when it is wet", "but with the wet brush it is supposed to be a lot better for your hair so that is why am brushing my hair first", "and then I am going to spray in some Sun bumm sea spray which is basically a matte texturizing spray that gives your hair that beachy like you came back from the beach which is definitely what we are going for", "so I am spraying a little bit of that", "then I am going to take my hair", "and I am going to twist it", "I am going to twist around my finger twist around my finger and", "I am going to do that all the way around my head", "so the next step is to use a diffuser which a diffuser either comes with the blow dryer that you have or you can get a universal extension and", "basically a diffuser is an extension to your blow dryer and it looks kind of like this very interesting looking this one actually came with the blow dryer and goes directly on it", "so what you are going to do is you are going to take this attachment", "put it on", "then you are going to turn the heat on to low", "so you are definitely going to want to keep it low and that will avoid a lot of frizz with this look", "and then you are going to take your hair and", "you are going to kind of pile it into the diffuser", "and this is how you use a diffuser", "and then you kind of crunch it up into your head", "so you are going to do this all around your head until your hair is completely dry and by doing this", "you are going to already have a nice wave", "and then we are going to go in and clean up the curls with a one inch curling iron to get that nice polished look if you are

going to section off my hair", "but I am going to start by taking the top half of my hair and sectioning it off with a clip I love these like crocodile clips these are perfect for sectioning off your hair for curling or a flat ironing or whatever", "I love them", "so I am clipping up the top portion of my hair", "and then I am going to go in and add curls", "so that is why take small sections",

if you have a Miss that you like it is nice because it adds a little bit more ingredients and it is a little bit better for your skin if you want to do it that way", "so that is why am going to use a little bit of strobe cream which is basically a light reflecting cream gives your skin that nice like luminous glow not does it moisturize your skin and hydrate it", "but it gives it like a nice glow", "and you are supposed to I was confused by this at first when I first got this product I do not realize you are supposed to put it on before you put on a tinted moisturizer or foundation which I thought was odd because I thought would not that cover up the strobe cream and the effect", "but that is how they do it", "that is how the pros do it according to all the YouTube tutorials I have been watching ok", "so that is why am going to use a tinted moisturizer I have a few foundations that", "I like I have this one in my kit", "right now this is the chantek I skin", "tinted

welcome back to my channel today", "I am doing some DIY hygiene hacks we are gonna be making some DIY deodorant and some shampoo and trying out some whit shave cream so a lot of fun things that do not actually take that long to make sometimes", "when you look at these they seem like oh my gosh", "I just rather go to the store and for some of us that is definitely the case", "but if you want to make some of these at home they are kind of easy", "and they are really effective the first one I ended up loving", "and it is the DIY deodorant", "it is relatively easy to make I use 100 pure shea butter", "and Oh Byron walked in my shot there and then coconut oil I will put all the measurements below you", "are going to melt that on a double boiler on medium heat medium to low heat next we are going to thicken it up with some arrowroot and some baking powder so this is the base of the deodorant which was easy to make", "and then you can add whatever essential oils you like I am going to add some grapefruit lavender and tea tree oil", "I would say out of all of the essential oils definitely add tea tree oil now essential oils are popular right now but definitely do your own research when adding them to your products there are different brands and a variety of different options when choosing essential oils I found was great little container at world market for 99 cents", "and I got a few of them", "and I am just adding the deodorant in there", "and I am gonna let it solidify now", "I got to be honest", "I was not sure what to expect from this because I have never tried making a natural deodorant or a homemade deodorant before if you follow my channel", "you know I love to experiment with these types of things", "but I was really impressed with this one for multiple reasons",

is going to become like that coconut oil texture", "then you are going to put it under your arms and then after a few minutes it dries up", "and it actually really works", "it keeps your underarms smelling good and keeps them dry so that is definitely something I am going to be making more I wanted to try another do it yourself shampoo", "so that is why am making a DIY coconut almond shampoo I am dissolving some honey in some warm water and also a little bit of coconut oil", "I am adding some almond castile soap and some coconut milk and mixing it together", "it is more of a consistency of a rinse rather than a traditional shampoo", "so I like this recipe as a kind of summer rinse especially since we have got the coconut almond smell and it really does kind of clean your hair and make your hair smell good", "but it does not have that same feeling as a shampoo next", "we are moving on to some DIY whipped", "shave cream which I loved this", "it had such a great texture and consistency", "again I am using coconut oil and shea butter", "so these are ingredients I kind of keep around because most of the DIY products I do make contain these ingredients and I do love coconut oil just by itself for my body my hair but by mixing them together and by adding different ingredients you can create your own beauty products pretty easily so over double boiler again I am melting those two together then adding some extra virgin olive oil I am going to put that in the refrigerator and let that cool down a little bit", "and then I am going to whip it up", "now you can whip it with a hand mixer now", "the reason you want to whip it up is because very similar to like an icing or something you want to add air in there so that it has that texture", "and that texture is really important for a shave cream because it adds a barrier when you are shaving your legs so that you do not cut yourself so I am going to add a little bit of eucalyptus after I have had a chance to whip it a bit", "and then I am going to whip it on high so that it gets really nice and whipped up again", "you can use a hand mixer or a Kitchen Aid or whatever you have but ideally you do want to add that air for this recipe because you want to get that whipped texture", "it has like a whipped cream really buttery like a very rich body butter that you could buy at a store", "and you are using a lot of these same ingredients for most of the DIY beauty products", "but the process is a little bit different for each of them so that you have a different effect", "but I did like this", "it was a very thick shade cream that is the one thing about this that it was", "you do not need to use any sort of lotion after you get out of the shower after using this because it does leave your legs

nighttime diaper", "and I give him a little massage now those solidified lotion bars and once they come in contact with warm skin they start to melt for me personally it is a little hard to do the baby massage every single night", "but I try to do it", "a few times a week one thing that works for me is giving my son a bedtime snack because in our family we have dinner kind of around 5 30 ish", "so by time he goes to bed", "he usually wants some type of snack and a snack that I recently realized is one of the better bedtime snacks is a banana because bananas contain magnesium and potassium which are natural muscle relaxants and Mel in serotonin", "I also add almond butter on top of that", "and he loves it", "he just devours it", "if your kids do not like almond butter maybe try peanut butter or it is totally up to you", "but bananas are definitely a good snack before bed", "and then I have been trying to do wine downtime so a quiet game or quiet playing something simple and then storytime", "it feels like life these days can be crazy and like hustle bustle", "so that is why try as often as I can to read to him before bed because it is just that quiet time", "and I can imagine with multiple kids it might be hard but maybe getting them all together to read a book", "there is another pretty quick and simple DIY that you can use for bedtime", "and that is a DIY pillow spray you need some distilled water and a little bit of witch hazel", "I use those spray bottles that you can find on Amazon", "and you just fill the spray bottle up with mostly distilled water a little bit of witch hazel", "and then some lavender drops and sweet orange essential oil drops", "and again you can use this on your bedding or your kids bedding", "I personally like to spray it a few hours before or just every few days so it is not very very strong", "and it is not like giving you a headache but a very faint relaxing scent", "and it smells nice", "it just makes the whole room smell warm so my son recently upgraded to a big boy bed", "and I could tell it was time to get a nightlight he did not have a nightlight before", "so that is why actually got this pink salt Himalayan lamp which is the color amber and amber", "I found out on Pinterest", "is the most ideal color to have as a nightlight because it is the most calming", "and I love pink Himalayan salt lamps because they are natural air purifiers and then I turn on his humidifier", "and that is it", "those are my best tacks that I have found and they seem to help so hopefully they help you guys out to check out my last two videos", "I have another channel and subscribe to my channel if you like these videos", "and I will see you very soon bye you"], "14pbQt0qO48": ["hey guys welcome back to my channel today is video", "we are focusing on do it yourself hand and foot treatments", "now I usually try to get gel manicures", "but I like to try to make them last as long as possible", "so that is why will turn my cuticles and do various treatments", "but I am testing out some new DIYs today", "and I wanted to share them with you on my channel", "so let is get started and start with some foot treatments if you are gonna be giving yourself a pedicure or someone else a pedicure you can do a foot bath", "and you can buy foot baths they are kind of expensive", "but you can also get a large bowl", "you can add some rocks to the bottom if you want so", "it is not a slippy and then add some warm water", "put some baking soda and Epsom salt in the bath and that will create kind of a basically a cleanser for your feet and a D stink of fire as well", "and so that is a good foot treatment you can see it is already kind of starting a bubble you can add flower petals if you want totally optional", "it is just for looks if you are giving someone else a pedicure you can add eucalyptus essential oil too as well to it so for the nice smell", "and then you are gonna place your feet in there and let them soak for about 10 to 15 minutes", "and then we are going to do a DIY callus treatment", "so today we are doing a DIY callus treatment which is basically an acidic mask that you are going to put on your feet to help dissolve the calluses on your feet", "so what you have is some smashed up strawberries", "some lemon and some honey and the lemon in the strawberries contain acid citric and salicylic", "and then you have the honey which is going to be hydrating", "and you are gonna basically apply that onto the heels of your feet or wherever you have callus on your feet some people will have them on their toes", "and I am just kind of dipping my heel in there", "and I have saran wrap on the towel", "and then I am going to wrap the saran wrap with the treatment around my feet and let that soak on my feet for about 15 minutes after 15 minutes remove off your feet put your feet back into the foot soap to remove the mask off of your feet so once the acidity has had a chance to kind of settle into the callus it is gonna soften that so that is why am using a callus remover", "I am using the amo pay which you can find at drug stores like Target and", "this one right now is supposed to be one of the better ones on the market I do wish it was a little bit stronger", "but I think they have a few different options you can choose from", "but it definitely is nice for making a pedicure last longer and not having to go back as often", "and it smooths out the area", "so next we are gonna do a final polish after with a do it yourself foot scrub and this is gonna be a peppermint foot scrub which is invigorating for your feet", "and you can also bring it up to your legs as well it is easy", "it is equal parts coconut oil which I love coconut oil it can be used for virtually anything as you saw in my last video", "I used it for my hair", "you can use it for your body", "and then I am gonna be using Epsom salt if you do not have Epsom salt you can use sea salt for this scrub or sugar if you wanted to and then peppermint oil which is again very invigorating and all these treatments", "are gonna hopefully help your feet smell and look and feel nice", "so that is why am using a little bit of this scrub", "and then you can also bring it up your legs as well and down your toes and", "just really massage it", "and then I am going to obviously wet my feet a little bit and", "then dry it all off", "believe it or not cuticle removing is controversial in the pedicure world", "but I have always been a big fan of it because I like the way it makes my hands and feet look much cleaner", "and I have had this tweezerman tool for a long time", "and I do trim my cuticles you have to be careful when you are trimming your cuticles obviously so that you do not cut yourself", "but I do regularly trim my cuticles myself", "and then I am making a DIY butter foot treatment this is like a foot treatment bar", "and I am making this with shea butter almond oil coconut", "and then you can use a essential oil of your choice", "basically you want to add this to a saucepan and let it all melt together", "and then I am gonna pour it in moulds and let it harden and basically that is gonna create a kind of like a lotion bar if you will once it is had a chance to completely cool", "you will notice that it turns solid", "and then you can use it as a lotion bar and it melts with the warmth of your hand", "and so that is why am using it on my feet", "and it is hydrating and moisturizing", "you can put some socks on and go to sleep after you have used this treatment so that completes the treatments for your feet next", "we are gonna move on to our hands now", "normally you can soak your fingers but since I have a gel manicure I want to avoid it from lifting so that is why am gonna wash my hands first with the intensive liquid hand soap that I have", "it is a intensive moisturizing liquid hand soap rather", "and it is shea butter", "and it is also antibacterial", "so it is moisturizing", "and then I am gonna use a nail brush to just clean out my nails", "another tip to to protect your manicure is when you are doing the dishes or any sort of house cleaning that you use gloves and that will help keep your hands a lot softer and cleaner looking", "but I do like to clean out my nails especially if you have a lighter color", "you will notice that a brush will help keep your nails looking clean", "so next I am making a DIY cuticle oil treatment super easy to make I am using some vitamin E oil but if you have olive oil you can certainly use that instead and also coconut oil", "and then I am gonna be using some essential oils", "I think I am using here peppermint eucalyptus lavender and grapefruit", "but you can use just one or two", "you can kind of do whatever you want which is the really cool thing about any of these you can totally customize them", "I keep it in the refrigerator just because it is fresh ingredients but you can use this on your hands", "but it is especially great for softening your cuticles before you push them back or trim them", "and like I said I do like to trim my cuticles and", "so that is what I am gonna do right now", "so finally I am gonna make a DIY hand cream I am using some essential oils the grapefruit and orange", "and it smelled really good", "I liked this on a double boiler I am basically taking cocoa butter and some almond oil some beeswax and two of my essential oils", "you can use basically any essential oil that you want to in any of these recipes whatever ones that you have", "I have kind of been collecting them", "and I have a bunch of different brands", "there is a few brands unfortunately that I am not allowed to use on my youtube channel because of FDA which is kind of unfortunate", "but I would suggest doing your own research about essential oils and which ones that you want to use I am using the ones that you can get at Whole Foods which are pretty accessible and easy to find", "but again if you are interested in that definitely do your own research on essential oils", "but I am adding grapefruit and orange", "and I think that that is a really nice combination for a hand cream", "I am gonna let that sit again with any of these hand", "creams you kind of have to let them sit once they have melted", "and then once the room temperature you can notice that it will will become more solidified or like a cream", "and you can use that on your hands", "and you can also use gloves or do this before you go to sleep for an intensive hand treatment", "but that completes this

hair and growing hair in this video", "I personally have been kind of putting my hair through a lot lately and trying to grow it out and just keep it healthy so that is why wanted to share some of my tips with you guys and hopefully it will help you out", "so my first tip is a scalp treatment if you are trying to grow out your hair", "a scalp treatment can be beneficial", "right now I am personally using the Kiehl", "is magic elixir", "and I like it because the top of the bottle allows you to just apply it directly onto your scalp", "and then I massage it in another scalp treatment that I have tried and really liked", "is the hair fertilizer which you can find it right aid", "it comes in a cream like this one", "or it comes in a little dropper", "I like the dropper better", "but it is a little bit harder to find", "I know", "Sally Beauty Supply has it but Rite Aid always has the cream and you massage it into your scalp if your hair is feeling really dry and unhealthy", "I definitely recommend an overnight oil treatment once a week I use coconut oil and", "when my hair was not color treated this sometimes would be a little bit too much 1 2 of a spoon full", "I would maybe only do like a teaspoon throughout your hair", "but when your hair is damaged the coconut oil hydrates and your hair sucks it up", "you can put your hair up in a bun and sleep overnight", "I comb it through my hair", "you might want to put a towel on your pillow because it can transfer and if you have oily skin that might be something to think about as well because the oil can transfer onto your skin", "the next tip is to take supplements if you are trying to grow out your hair", "and I ordered these sugar bear hair vitamins because I kept seeing them being advertised on Instagram and I am a total sucker", "so", "yes I am not advertising these myself", "but I was a sucker and bought them because I wanted to see what all the fuss was about they do taste good which I imagine would make it easier to remember to take them", "but", "I also really like the vivid scale supplements which my hairdresser friend recommended to me for hair loss", "and I had some postpartum hair loss so if you are experiencing hair loss those are great too", "but if you do not like to swallow vitamins maybe try the sugar bear ones and I will keep you posted on what I think about those so in the morning I brushed my hair out", "and then you want to", "you wash it out", "really good", "so I had planned to take a shower in the morning anyway", "Oliver usually plays with his little cars on the bathtub while I am getting ready in the morning", "but I made sure to give my hair a good wash to get all that coconut oil out", "otherwise your hair can appear greasy and depending on you know what type of hair you have adjust the coconut oil amount", "if you are not into the overnight hair oil thing you could do a hair pack once a week which you can find these at the drugstore you can find them at higher end stores", "it is basically a deep conditioner or hair mask that you keep on for five to ten minutes and then at the end of your shower always turn your shower to cold", "let the cold water rinse through your hair that helps close the hair cuticle and make your hair look really shiny this one is a tough one for me I will admit because I like to put my hair up in the towel", "but if you are noticing breakage or unhealthy hair you want to gently Pat the towel against your hair to prevent breakage", "I was told that it is important to use a wide tooth comb instead of a traditional hairbrush when brushing damp hair because that can cause breakage so I do use a wide toothed comb and then some type of serum or elixir", "spray you can find all sorts of of these types of things it is a ten is a good one", "but right now I have this golden elixir by Kerastase", "and I like it", "it made my hair super soft and shiny", "so that is the one I am using right now", "if you can avoid heat let your hair dry naturally", "but if you have to go out and blow dry", "your hair try using the cold shot and another tip that really works for me", "and I have mentioned before in my channel",

minutes after using mouthwash you are less likely to spread anything contagious that you might have to someone else", "so I do not know", "mouthwash definitely helps", "and then I am using my facial steamer with some eucalyptus essential oil usually", "my facial steamer is for my skin for opening up my pores and I use it for you know different skincare routines or if I am doing a facial or

when I do these things I have a more productive day", "and it is a good way to kind of start the morning for me", "so it is not a morning routine in the sense that I get a chance to do it every single day", "but these are some habits that I like to create for my mornings", "one habit that seems simple and kind of insignificant is to fix your bed", "and I do not always do this", "and I do notice the difference when I do fix my bed", "and I feel like I have gone in and out of this habit pretty much my whole life my parents do stories they fix your bed Rachel before you go to school um but fixing your bed", "it is a great way to get up and get started", "and also I wash my pillowcases and my sheets once a week and not does my bed feel fresh but also your pillowcases can contain a lot of germs and bacteria from your skin and from sleeping", "so it is just really important to obviously wash your pillowcases and your sheets and I wash it in hot water for the last few years I have been using white sheets", "um I do not know where I heard this from or where I got this idea", "but it is a lot easier for me to clean", "and I mentioned this in my house tour you throw it in hot water with bleach", "and it keeps it fresh and brand new looking for a long time it is called hotel bedding so you can wash your pillowcases twice a week", "and your bedding at least once a week", "if you want or your pillowcases once a week it is up to you", "so the next habit is to cleanse your skin twice a day which I know can be hard sometimes the most important to remove your makeup that is the most important if you had to choose but trying to cleanse twice a day", "is a really good habit to get into because you build up sebum oil at night when you sleep and your dead skin cells slough a little bit", "so I am using a konjac sponge and", "some enzyme cleanser I was sent this sponge by a viewer who lives in Japan and", "if you watch my peel box video it was in that video and it is very gentle even more gentle than a Clarisonic", "so that is why like to use that on my off days when I am not using my Clarisonic a good tip", "is to finish cleansing your skin with cold water which is better than warm water because cold water helps with puffiness reducing puffiness and it is better for your skin overall a habit that I learned when I worked in skincare", "was to use an antioxidant serum in the daytime antioxidants are vitamins A C and E", "and they are basically what fight free radicals free radicals are environmental aggressors that are hard on our body and hard on our skin so by using antioxidants by eating foods that are rich in antioxidants we help prevent free radicals from attacking our body our skin another healthy habit is wearing sunscreen by keeping your skin out of the Sun you are preventing hyperpigmentation fine lines and wrinkles but also skin cancer is a real thing and so protecting your skin from the Sun is important wearing sunscreen every day is a great habit to get yourself into", "I find that sunscreen can not feel that great on my skin so after searching through a bunch of different sunscreens the ones that have serum texture", "are my favorite and wearing it everyday is going to make a difference in your skin long term", "this one is totally optional but I find this one fun because if I am not gonna take a shower I spritz a little bit of Amazing Grace

lemon water in the morning", "sometimes I do it with warm water sometimes I do it with cold", "but I usually try to do it with warm water", "and I find it to kind of cleanse", "my palate", "I always feel like first thing I get up in the morning", "I just want something sweet and drinking lemon water right away", "is a great way to kind of cleanse my palate and start my system", "I am not a huge coffee drinker honestly although I love it", "it makes me kind of jittery", "but I do love green tea", "so that is why have green tea with my breakfast my breakfast varies every morning", "but I do try to start with something every day and even if it is just a bowl of fruit I am usually hungry a half an hour later", "but hey at least it is something that got me started the green tea", "has lots

three minutes", "but you do not have to use this you can boil traditional quinoa if you want this happens to be like a fast and easy salad that I like to do for lunch", "so first I take arugula and

fish", "but today I just was in the mood for like a light salad and", "this is actually pretty filling the quinoa fills you up and so that is why could get some lemon juice", "some olive oil some salt and pepper", "and then you have a light simple easy to make salad that you can add chicken or fish to if you want um", "but it just depends on how hungry you are for lunch", "so I ate the entire thing

gonna start with a kind of cilantro like cream dressing", "and I have the recipe again below in the description", "but it is basically avocado lime and cilantro", "and I am gonna add a little bit of

fish you can always do veggie tacos", "you could do chicken tacos whatever you prefer um", "but these are kind of traditional fish tacos", "and it is about 4 or 5 minutes on each side before it starts to get nice and kind of crusted and dark", "and then you are going to want to flip it", "and then you are going to want to shred it for your tacos", "we do a variation of taco night", "so just all

cilantro dressing and", "then a little wedge of lime next to the tacos", "I will usually have three bearing will usually have three and then Oliver will have like one and a half", "um so that is like

foundations", "but I really liked this brush because a", "I do not like dipping my fingers in foundation so that is why think that that was really innovative", "and I do not like dipping my fingers in moisturizers", "either so that is why use this for my moisturizer", "and then I found this to be a really great brush", "I think obviously it was designed to be used with this foundation", "so it is a good combination if you notice any like enlarged pores or fine lines it kind of makes your skin look like you have a snapchat filter on it which is always a good thing", "so this cheek and eye palette

they also have a double sided lip gloss lipstick combo that I am loving right now", "and it is like a nude almost like coral e", "so that is why put on the lipstick first on the other side you have the perfectly matching lip", "gloss", "I love this color because it is like a few shades darker than my own lip color and that is a tip when you are applying makeup I like to naturally enhance", "and

skin", "but it is good skincare maintenance at the very least", "so that is why want to teach you how to do an at home facial", "so a traditional facial will usually start with removing the makeup and cleansing the skin so if you have makeup you can remove it", "and then you want to give your skin a good cleanse", "and this is obviously what we do in a traditional skin routine as well", "but in a facial you can add the Clarisonic I do not like to use the Clarisonic every single day because I feel like it purges me a little bit", "but if I use it every three days or every time I do a facial which is like once a week", "it seems to be a nice addition to my current skincare routine", "I actually use the deep pore cleansing brush head and usually when you get a facial a lot of places will use a Clarisonic", "and then they will normally remove the cleanser from your skin and the next step", "is to exfoliate gently kind of buff off the top layer of skin", "and you can do that with a physical or chemical exfoliant in this case I am using a physical exfoliant", "this is by fresh", "it smells really good", "it is like a brown sugar", "and you want to try to be as gentle as possible with your skin obviously I kind of tug at it", "a little harder than maybe I probably should", "but by adding water you can be even more gentle so scrubs that include granules like a sugar scrub is considered a physical exfoliation", "and then you also have a chemical option that you can choose as well but", "usually when you are getting a facial", "they do some type of exfoliation and if they are doing a gentle peel they will use a chemical so after I exfoliate I like to do a facial steam and when you get a traditional facial they will usually have a steamer off to the side kind of blowing steam on your skin and this opens up your pores", "I have this really wonderful machine", "I got I think as a gift", "and I use it", "and it is great", "it opens up your pores if you do not have one of those you can easily put boiling hot water in a bowl you obviously want to be careful", "but you just put your over it and let the steam open up your pores and while your pores are open it is time to do a mask now you can do any type of treatment mask you can do brightening anti aging firming it could be a cream mask", "a gel mask", "I like these sheet masks", "they are fun", "and so I am going to use this aloe one", "right now usually when you get a facial the esthetician will take a look at your skin and they will assess what type of mask they want to use on you so that is why kind of have to pay attention to your skin when you are giving yourself an at home facial and decide what type of mask is useful for your skin at the moment if your skin is feeling dry you might want to do a moisturizing or hydrating mask", "just choose a mask according to your skin type these are funny", "and they are kind of scary", "make you look like an axe murderer", "even my son was like hey mom",

movie read a magazine clean up a little bit", "try to get my son to kiss me you know the huge", "and then I take it off", "I like to use a toner spray like this one from Kota Lee", "this is the beauty elixir", "and I just spray this on my skin after the mask and", "this is something I noticed in many facials that I have had that they do", "so you have prepped your skin for treatments if it is a m", "I will do a vitamin C rich concentrate like this one", "some sort of rich vitamin C serum", "and then I like facial oils", "right now I have one that I use in the a m", "and then at night I use a retinol I love this product because it is a fast delivering like retinol treatment so that is why can apply it and tap it into your skin at night", "I prefer to use retinol at night because they do resurface the skin since everyone is", "skin is so different it is important to try to see an aesthetician or a dermatologist if possible to kind of get the right routine for you", "this is the routine that works for my skin type for AM and PM and the products that I am using", "but you do want to use some sort of treatment and kind of follow these steps that is generally the steps that are followed in a facial especially after applying oils you can do your own facial massage with just your fingers and that will help bring blood flow to the skin", "but you will find that it is very common that when getting a facial that they will use a microcurrent device or an LED light or kind of one of these specialty machines if you will that help tighten and firm your skin", "so this is a microcurrent device you can find these they are sold at most beauty stores", "it is like Pilates for your face or exercise for your face and", "then an LED light therapy treatment is also very common during facials for rejuvenating the skin preventing wrinkles it is hard to have a million different beauty products", "but this one has three changing heads that also do LED and microcurrent", "so

I am slightly OCD", "and I like to keep things clean", "but it is not always possible to do that especially with a two year old", "so that is why kind of like looked around and assessed in my house", "what needed some help and there is a few areas like my craft and holiday closet definitely needed some help I had my toiletries area that with all the paper towels and things like that that needed help by drawers there were some areas that I kind of decided needed some organization help and before I can even think about excelling in any other area in my life", "I always feel like my space has to be organized and clean that is how I function", "otherwise I get too distracted and feel like there is other things I need to be doing", "so the first thing I wanted to get done this year before I do any of my other resolutions is to organize the areas in my house that I needed organizations so i wanted to share with you guys what i did", "and that is what this video is all about", "so it is going to jump right in", "so the first area i decided to tackle is the holiday in craft closet which no matter how much i tried to kind of organize it still always looked cluttered to me", "so i decided to take everything down which", "i knew would take me some time and divide it all and categorize it all and put it back so that everybody kind of was clear where everything was so that is why got these bins from Target in all different sizes", "I actually measured the closet itself", "I divided it by categories and colors", "so I have the colored ornaments", "then I have the silver ornaments", "and then I had a box for lights and ribbons now depending on the extent of your holiday decor", "I did not have too much", "but I did organize it all away", "and you know depending on the extent of what you have you might need bigger boxes or a bigger closet", "but I think the point is to kind of categorize and put it all away neatly", "so you know where everything is", "so I started with that that I moved to my Easter box which was one box because I did not have too much for Easter", "and then I have a lot for fall because I am a big fan of fall and decorating for fall", "my mom used to do it a lot as a kid so it brings back really good memories", "so I put all that away in boxes as well over the last year", "or two", "I have built up a craft closet which I was never a crafty type of ghoul until I realized that doing it in my free time was actually kind of therapeutic and cathartic", "and I like to craft when I am in the mood", "so that is why needed to organize everything and put everything away because whenever I would go back to do a craft I never really knew where everything was or", "it was kind of cluttered", "and I did my best to organize", "but I did also categorize and put them all in six kind of smaller shoe boxes and stacked them inside of the cabinet", "now I think that this looks much cleaner obviously than what it looked before and when I am going to look for something I will know exactly where it is and", "the key to that is labeling you can get these labels from staples", "these are cool you stick them in your printer", "and then they have a website and for free you can create a customized label now", "I like to go for something more simple Oliver was interested in what I was doing", "I went for a clear label", "but I could print out", "I think it was like 9 at a time", "and you could customize each label so that is why wrote Christmas and then specified under Christmas what was in that specific box", "so that is why when I look at the box it tells me exactly what is in there even though it is see through if there is other items you know", "it is pretty clear", "now this is not for someone who is OCD", "it actually genuinely helps out when somebody in the family is looking for something specifically for it to be in a box and to be labeled", "it just makes it makes it easier to find things to be honest", "and it does not really take that much time", "so this was definitely one of my resolutions to kind of get this specific area in order because every time we d go to look for something I think we d kind of be frustrated", "and I went back and tried to kind of organize everything and make it look good", "but it never looked as good as I think what this looks so that is why am pretty happy with this", "and then on the side of the door I actually put a few nails to hang up my ribbon which I like how this ended up looking because it just looked clean and the ribbons like", "right there you can obviously put your ribbon away in another box but that is the way that I did it", "so it did not take that much extra time", "and I was so happy once it was finished", "but I wanted to tackle the toiletries area next which is where I keep all averse diapers wipes back up toilet paper and paper towels", "now this area always inevitably gets cluttered and we throw the diapers back in there", "I just did not like how it looked so it was one of my goals to kind of find some bins to organize", "I found these bins again at Target I put all the toilet paper in the big bin and then paper towels in the medium", "and then the diapers in the small", "so instead of putting everything in the cabinet which inevitably becomes cluttered I decide to have a bin for each specific thing that way everybody kind of knows where everything goes", "and I realized this especially when we had guests over for Christmas that people did not know where everything was and that made me feel frustrated some of the areas at my house", "are organized and there were some areas like the ones I am showing you today that we could never it just always looked cluttered somehow", "and so I am hoping these work out for us", "so next I wanted to tackle the pantry which the pantry is actually one area in my house that stays pretty organized because when we moved in we bought a bunch of oxo containers and labeled all of our nuts and dried goods and everything like the rice and everything is organized and my husband is a chef so that is why loves everything to kind of be visible but the one area that was not organized was my teas", "so I decided to pull them all out", "I love tea", "I am an avid tea drinker I drink it in the morning and at night", "and I have so many different boxes", "so that is why decided to organize it", "I got more oxo containers which you can find at HomeGoods usually on sale", "and I am categorizing the teas so that I have herbal teas in one area", "and then my green tea in another area again easy to find", "and it is not cluttered", "you really the key with organization is just so that you can find everything", "and we love how our pantry is because it is easy to find all the nuts and dried Goods and rice", "and we know where everything is pastas and things like that", "and you label it", "and I love these oxo containers for that reason", "so that is why have a label maker", "and I do print out what is in there", "so this one is herbal tea", "and then I have one for my green tea", "and I went ahead and put that back", "and it looked so much cleaner", "i order my paradise iced tea off of amazon in bulk for the summer", "so i keep that in glass mason jars or in glass containers because i have so much of it", "but now all of my teas are organized the next area I wanted to tackle", "was", "Oliver is toys", "now he is a very lucky little boy and he has so many toys", "and he got even more for Christmas", "so I definitely had the goal to go through and purge and he helped me out", "we have little bins", "and then we also have a toy chest", "but we went through", "and I just kind of looked at the toys", "and if he had not used it or it was something that he does not play with we cleaned it off", "and we donated it", "and it really it decluttered his toy area", "and also I think it is good to do this with kids especially as they get older you know to donate their toys and not just donate toys that no longer work or are broken or anything like that but actually good toys", "you know that other kids will love and appreciate so that is why got these two bins from Target one was for his Legos and one", "was for his cars because he is obsessed with Hot Wheel cars I got rid of you know any old coloring books things like that the two small bins are for his toys that he uses the most", "and they help with teaching him to clean up before bed", "so we love those um and then Step five was to organize my beauty cabinet which I like these drawers I am trying to find more of these plastic drawers because these ones are a little dingy", "but I could not find them at Target", "so that is why got one big large basket to put everything in because it was starting to kind of look cluttered", "I do try to keep that area organized and clean it every once in a while", "but I like this big basket a little bit better and", "then one area that I have a little bit of an OCD with keeping clean is my drawers and our drawers in general", "it is really hard to do it though especially when you are trying to keep up with laundry and as you can see everything is you know kind of all over the place in my shirt drawer right now the best way for me to keep my laundry organized", "is to do small loads every day throughout the day and then one of my first traditional jobs I worked in the entertainment industry as a kid but one of my kind of more traditional jobs I worked at a store folding clothes I worked in retail and ever since then they gave me like a little clipboard to fold all the clothes", "and I kind of became obsessed with it", "but this time I bought these oxo Good Grips and", "I try really hard to keep my clothes folded because they can stack nicely on top of each other and that is a trick that I learned that I will forever use", "but I love these little dividers because they kind of help to keep the drawers organized and the drawers are forever reworking to keep them organized but that is where I learned my folding skills", "and I still try to kind of keep that in the back of my head because I actually loved that job it taught me a lot", "um I do not always use the clipboard at this point I have kind of memorized how to fold it and especially if I do not have time", "and I am in a rush", "but I try to", "and I try

am definitely one of those people I love a gift that is pampering so that is why am going to make a DIY scrub that you can make and give away to your family and friends if they enjoy pampering all you

all sorts of different holiday", "themed stencils", "and you basically use whatever colors you want and you create a design a pattern on the tile itself that you do use acrylic paint because it makes

savory version with eze and a cutting board", "and then we have a version with kind of like kettle corn and coffee and hot cocoa and baked apples and things like that", "so just stuff to snack on", "I definitely know people who would appreciate these great items to bring to parties as well for the person who appreciates entertainment whether it is a child or an adult you can totally customize this

I have been seeing a lot of like", "hacks videos lately online", "they seem to be pretty popular so today I am talking about cleaning which we all have to do even if you have somebody come and help you clean your house", "you still have to kind of clean up after yourself", "and I know at least for me", "I am not a huge fan of using products that contain chemicals", "you know there is a lot of products that you can pull out of your refrigerator or kind of easy ways to make cleaning a little bit more simple without using products that contain chemicals", "so that is what I am doing today a lot of DIY cleaning hacks and things like that", "so we are just going to jump right in", "so the first DIY is a kitchen sink polish this one is really easy and most of us have", "these two ingredients in our refrigerators are ready or in our pantries I am taking half of a lemon", "and then I am adding salt on top I am using this to scrub my sink", "and it works like a charm the salt and the lemon work together to get rid of all the grime and yuckiness that is in your sink", "and you do not have to touch a dirty sponge", "so that is why like this", "and it does a good job at polishing", "plus you get the wonderful smell of a lemon which kind of helps combat the odors that can come from a kitchen sink so after you are done with this you can throw it down the disposal",

so", "so definitely try this method out and let me know how it works for you", "I love it", "it seems just really easy", "and you know we all have to clean our kitchen sinks even though it is", "gross right", "okay", "next is the DIY microwave steam clean", "this was actually pretty cool", "it is", "equal parts water and equal parts vinegar", "now you are going to be putting this into the microwave and microwaving it on high for about 10 minutes you want to keep your eye on it", "so it does not boil over but the concept is that it will create a steam in your microwave and then you can go in there with a sponge or a towel and kind of wipe away the sides and it makes the cleaning of your microwave easy now it depends on how long it is been since you have cleaned your microwave", "I prefer to try to you know maintain it and clean it as often as possible so that it stays clean", "and this is kind of a great maintenance to do once a week", "but it is not", "it is not as great if you need to do a deep cleanse", "but it does help the steam definitely does help so you can go in there with a strong sponge now", "the next thing is cleaning out a Keurig which I got to admit this is the first time I have done this", "so you basically fill the reservoir that you usually put your water into with vinegar", "so", "yes you fill it to the very top with vinegar and vinegar", "is a common ingredient for a lot of household DIY recipes and then you are going to basically brew you are going to take out any coffee pods or anything that you might have in there", "and you are just going to brew it and keep brewing it and brewing it and bringing it till it is clear", "right now you can see kind of the color and that is its way of cleaning out the Keurig after it is completely clear", "you are gonna then wash out the reservoir that holds all the water and clean it out", "I even you know will use a little soap and water", "you could run it through the dishwasher", "but you know you want to be careful because then your coffee is gonna taste like vinegar if you do not really wash it good enough", "so then I am going to run another round two or three rounds so that I get out that vinegar taste throughout the Keurig", "and then yet you have a clean cure egg I always wondered how to keep Legos clean", "and then I stumbled upon the easiest Pinterest trick of all time which is just to take a mesh bag and throw all of the Legos in there", "and then Oliver is obviously helping me although he was a little disappointed he wanted to know where I was taking his Legos", "but I assured him that they would be back to him in better condition than how he left them but basically throw them in the wash", "and you add", "you know whatever washer you use or whatever you use to wash your clothes", "and then you just wash them", "and then when you are done you can lay them out on a clean towel out in the Sun and let them dry", "and then you have perfectly clean Legos and", "I am telling you right now", "I looked at his Legos before and after and there was such a huge difference", "it was like they were polished", "and I felt happy", "and this is also a great option during flu season and this time of the year when maybe kids are sick and you do not want them transferring you know", "sickness", "Hey cleaning the Legos is easy and very effective so quick tip for cleaning Legos again with flu season around the corner", "a disinfecting household cleaner never hurts", "so this is equal parts water and vinegar adding some lemon essential oil and then also tea tree oil and", "this is a quick and easy way to clean your countertops", "you know any areas like doorknobs or things like that I use a glass container", "and I tend to not be able to find bigger sizes with that because when you are using the essential oils glass containers are ideal but this is very effective and it works very well for cleaning counter tops next", "we have a DIY Swiffer", "now I have the actual Swiffer itself the little mop", "but it is expensive to keep buying the Swiffer containers over and over again so a sock an old sock is a great way to dust and actually we all have an old sock that we can use", "so that is why dust around like mirrors or you know different areas around the house that have dust", "and I can also you can take an old sock", "and you can cut it", "and you can put it on your Swiffer so if you do not want to keep buying the Swiffer refills over and over and over again use the sock and you can use that to clean like the edges of your floor is where it gets dusty and it works really really great", "so it does not attract the dust the same way", "but I think it is just as effective", "so those are my quick tips hopefully you enjoyed if you do like my

first", "but on my lazy days Byron lets me sleep in", "so Oliver will come and greet me", "and he knows I am up", "and I will just snuggle with him play with him", "he always loves to come in and say hi and just goof around", "so I chill in bed with Oliver for a little bit", "and then we get up and head out to make breakfast before I got to get breakfast", "I try to squeeze in some sort of facial routine", "so I put my hair up", "I usually try to wash my face", "I am always switching up my cleanser", "but right now my current cleanser is", "the fresh soy face cleanser", "this is the first time I have ever tried this", "I like it", "and I like the smell it smells like cucumbers although Byron thinks it smells like pickles so we have a difference of opinion there now for my lazy morning routine", "I will pick out a sunscreen", "I like this one it is lightweight", "and I like the tinted ones", "so that is why will usually apply that because today the weather is nice so I will either go outside and like garden or sit outside and relax", "so that is why will put a sunscreen on for the day if I know I am going to be inside all day", "I will just pick out my favorite moisturizer and put that on", "and then I head out to the kitchen and make myself some breakfast today I am having", "a little yogurt parfait", "I have some vanilla yogurt", "I added some Barenaked granola and then a little bit more vanilla yogurt on top", "and then I am finishing with granola", "you could certainly add fruit", "but I did not have any", "and so that is why used the country pumpkin spice granola so this is just like some granola yogurt", "but normally I d add some like chopped up apples you could do", "raspberries strawberries", "but this is a little bit more of a fall parfait because of the pumpkin", "and then I am gonna add a little bit of honey on top", "and this is my idea of a light refreshing breakfast", "I will have this or fruit or a banana every day is kind of different to be honest", "I do not have the same thing every day", "but this is something I do enjoy", "I am not a big coffee drinker whatsoever", "but I do love tea and", "right now I am loving", "this yogi ginger tea feel it just tastes yummy", "and I enjoy a cup of hot tea in the morning", "I will take this outside if the weather is looking nice", "and I will relax usually I put my son down for his first nap at between 9 30 and 10 30 depending on how he is acting", "and so that is why will play with him up until this point make breakfast usually right after I put him down to sleep", "and I will sit and relax if I am having a lazy day on most days I do not have lazy days so that is why do not do this", "but on a lazy day this is my idea of the perfect lazy day which is sitting outside enjoying outside eating a good breakfast thinking and not being on social media just relaxing", "I do not know I love being outside so drinking my tea and enjoying my little granola parfait and Oliver takes a nap I would say it is usually between maybe like two hours", "two and a half hours it kind of depends", "so I will watch a show that I have taped or something that I am been in the mood to watch like pentatonix", "I just watched that documentary I have been watching a lot of music documentaries ever since I launched my music channel and been thinking a lot about music", "so I adored this documentary and", "my perfect idea of a lazy day is when Oliver sleeping", "and I have nothing else to do which is a dream I love to catch up on shows watch documentaries that I have been meaning to watch I love this Celine Dion one", "sometimes I will just put this on and have it playing in the background because I love hearing her sing and I love her demeanor", "and I love her", "so that is my idea of just chilling and having a good time catching up on all the shows that I have not had a chance to watch all week", "and then if I am in the mood I will go do a little treatment in this case",

different options from this brand called que Bella", "and I have known about this for since I was pretty young", "and I always get these one or two dollar masks", "but in this case I just found these these are the hand and foot masks or like mittens", "so that is why thought that this would be a good time on a lazy day when I do not have anything to do that", "is a good time to do a treatment like this or you could put it on before you go to bed if you want", "but I am a big fan of trying these out", "this was the first time I tried these", "I think you can do a little bit of a better job by just applying lotion and getting the gel socks and the gel gloves", "but I thought I would test these out and", "these are perfect if you do not have those types of gloves so that is why am going to put this on as a fun little treatment I am going to keep watching my show", "and I am gonna finish as much of my show as I possibly can until Oliver wakes up and then keeps me on my toes for the next

welcome back to my channel and to my kitchen today I am doing another kids mommy video", "and I am doing DIY snacks for kids", "I mean I guess they snacks work for all types of kids", "but I would say like toddler age and up these are snacks that you know all of us loved", "I am sure as kids like fruit roll ups and goldfish and things like that", "but it is kind of nice to know all the ingredients that are going into what you are feeding your children especially when it comes to snacks because like every other toddler or most toddlers my son can be picky about what he eats like he does not like me", "and he like definitely does not like veggies I tried my hardest to like feed him the ones that he will eat umm", "but I mean he definitely loves snacks and he is always asking me for snacks that is him", "ho goodness", "I bet you he wants a snack anyway", "so today I am making ki a do it yourself snacks that I found on Pinterest", "so this is kind of like a Pinterest hacks video sharing with you guys some of the things that I pinned", "I pinned a lot when I was pregnant", "I did a ton of pinning when I was pregnant hoping that I would definitely get around to it at some point", "and so now that he is a toddler I am definitely trying out some of the ideas like the you know the fun little games and do it yourself crafts and food and snacks and things like that", "so hopefully you guys enjoyed this video and we will jump right in", "so snacks are great and all", "and I definitely love to treat Oliver to crackers and various bars and things like that", "but I always tried to maintain um you know fruits and vegetables as much as I can", "in his diet he really loves berries he does love carrots and cucumbers so that is why make these little snack pods you can add anything you want to these snack pods", "it could be cubes of cheese and pretzels", "but I try to do really healthy options since I know my son will just devour berries", "I will have a side for berries and then cucumber and some carrots", "and I will put it in these little snack pods and", "if he asks me for a snack which he will usually come over and let me know like hey mom", "I want a snack or", "I will ask if he wants a snack I will have a few of these ready to go", "they are good once you cut the veggies and fruit for about maybe three days", "so that is why will pre make these and offer it to him if he asks me for a snack if he does not finish it all I will put it back in the refrigerator", "but I like to have these healthy options ready to go on hand", "and I know", "with the cucumber it is already cut it is the perfect size for him to eat snack pods", "are definitely a quick and easy way to feed your toddler something", "healthy and even older kids", "you could definitely put this in their lunch boxes next up", "we have fruit roll ups which I have been seeing all over Pinterest and dying to make for Oliver because I remember I used to love fruit roll ups", "so that is why will have the full ingredient list of course in the description", "but basically it is just honey which I have this this Honey that I get from sprouts and some organic berries", "and I put that all in my food processor and process that away", "and then I", "you are gonna pour it on Silpat and you are gonna actually cook it", "and it you are gonna bake it for", "I think it is about six hours", "it is definitely a long time so keep in mind that it is basically dehydrating it so after what seems like an eternity in the oven you are going to take it out", "and it is actually dehydrated at that point which is fabulous because you can just pull it right off the baking sheet", "and then you are going to put it on to some parchment paper", "and then you are just going to roll it like you do with the traditional fruit roll ups", "and then I like to cut it to make them smaller portions there is another option that you can choose to do and that is to strain the seeds looking back that might be something I do if I ever make this again in the future which I do think I will do because my son really liked this a lot he is a big fan of berries on their own and this is berries with a little honey you can add more or less to your taste", "but these were pretty tart", "so they were not SuperDuper sweet", "and he still liked them as like a special treat or snack and especially if you are potty training or", "you are around that age", "this is a great snack or treat if they have used the potty or", "you know it is good reinforcement", "so the bottom line is that I am a big fan of these", "and I definitely divided them", "I did not give them all to him at once because he went crazy and wanted more and more and more", "but I I do not know brought me back to my childhood and how much I loved fruit roll ups", "and I was glad that he liked him and to know what actually went inside of them um but big hit next we are making homemade goldfish which is another one that I saw on Pinterest and had to try", "and I was so amazed by this recipe I loved it", "so again full recipe will be in the description but I am adding cheddar cheese and some flour now of course if there is a type of flour that you like to use for your children you can certainly use that and make it even more of a healthy option I like that these are made from home and obviously just some butter and a little bit of salt", "and then again I am gonna put it in the food processor and process it until you start to see the color come out the cheese and", "you will see that the cheese will start to make its appearance as it becomes more and more orange", "so I am going to remove the top of the food processor I am going to take a spatula and kind of push everything down in the middle and go ahead and process it one more time through to it", "is really really smooth", "you want like a sandy texture", "and then I am going to remove the top again and slowly add a little bit of water", "I believe it is a tablespoon at a time", "and we are going to do two", "so that is why am going to add a little bit I am going to run it through the food processor", "take off the top add a little bit", "again run it through the food processor", "and then we are going to have the dough that we need to make our goldfish with a spatula I am going to take the dough out of the food processor and on to some plastic wrap because it needs to chill in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes while the dough chills in the refrigerator be sure to set your oven to 350 degrees which is the temperature that it needs to be at when you cook after the dough has chilled for 30 minutes you are going to roll the dough out", "and then these taste very very similar to cheez its and", "also goldfish", "so you can make squares if you want I actually made a little fish out of a Perrier", "can and used that to create the little fish now obviously it is bigger and thicker than a traditional goldfish", "but it tasted like it", "and I have to say I even got my chef husband to approve he was eating them", "and he said wow", "those tastes really good", "they tasted like cheez", "its and goldfish we were so blown away", "so that is why created a bunch of little cutouts and put it on to a baking sheet", "and I am gonna bake it for about 15 minutes so it does not take very long at all I left it in for about 17 minutes because I felt like at 15 minutes it needed a little bit longer", "so that is why would say 16 minutes is probably the perfect amount to bake depending on the temperature of your oven and how your oven works exactly but about between 15 and 17 minutes I added a little bit of salt on top and this is obviously a special treat that looked like a lot of salt", "but it was not that much", "I promise um this was a special treat for Oliver and", "I loved them", "he loved them", "Byron loved them", "they were definitely a hit for the family", "so that is why would definitely try these out it", "it feels good to know that you made even if it is kind of a guilty pleasure snack like you", "made it at your own home", "and you know everything that went in there", "so those were a hit", "so I do not know about your house but in my house we definitely love peanut butter and jelly sandwiches", "I I mean come on does not every toddler love a peanut butter and jelly", "sandwich", "so when my son goes to Grandma is house um she always has the Uncrustables", "and she feeds them to him because he loves them", "so I am like I could make that obviously I do not like to waste so that is why do eat the edges because I feel bad throwing it away", "but I do make this little airplane shape um kind of like Uncrustables peanut butter and", "jelly sandwiches for Oliver and he loves them", "I mean the perfect size you can pre make them he always plays with them because he thinks they are actually like airplanes so that is why will like make the noise like", "right now he is making the noise going", "but it is a fun easy very very easy", "I think most mom is kind of do this for their kids", "um peanut butter and jelly sandwich are definitely a hit so that is why get those at Target", "you can get those cut outs and then finally we have fruit snacks", "which again fruit snacks are another super yummy treat for kids", "but it is good to know that you are making them at home", "and you are kind of controlling the ingredients that go in there", "so that is why am starting again with a food processor I have frozen berries that I have kind of been sitting out for a little bit", "so they are not super super frozen so that is why have the berries and I processed those I am going to put those into a pan a stovetop pan", "and I am going to cook it on medium to low heat", "I am adding some lemon juice and a little bit of honey", "so in the saucepan you are going to heat the strawberries and the lemon juice and honey", "and then you are going to float once that gets hot", "you are going to slowly add some gelatin slowly add a little bit at a time and whisk it in there", "and the key is to add a little bit at a time and", "it is thoroughly absorbed so that you do not get lots and lots of clumps", "so that is why am going to do that you are going to let it reduce a little bit", "and then you are going to put it in a pan", "and then you are going to stick it in the refrigerator and let it refrigerate for about eight hours or overnight", "so essentially these are basically like jello", "but it was reduced a little bit more", "so it is even chewier", "like a fruit snack it is similar to a fruit snack", "but it resembles jello a little bit more for me", "and I left it out", "and it was a little warm", "and it kind of melted", "I cut them into squares but you could cut different shapes out you can kind of do whatever you want with them", "but again with this recipe very similar to the fruit roll up recipe I probably would have preferred if I strained the seeds and did not have the seeds in there", "but I will say they tasted tangy not as sweet as a traditional fruit", "stat snack and", "my son still really liked them", "he ate them and enjoyed them so that is why will maybe try a little bit of a different method and tweak it next time", "but um I mean those were a hit as well", "so hopefully you guys enjoyed this video", "and if you did thumbs up subscribe to my

never thought I could achieve it has helped me make more space in my schedule for things that I never thought I had time for before that I actually do have time for so", "last year I got this louboutin planner off of Poshmark", "I love it", "it is definitely easy to carry around", "it is a beautiful planner you can get little inserts like these ones I got these on Etsy", "you can make them yourself", "but I love supporting the stores on Etsy where people make things from their home", "I think it is cool that you can create a business and sell things on Etsy from home so that is why am all about supporting that", "and so that is why got these little dividers I still use this one", "this one is more where I jot down everything that is in my main monthly calendar", "and I bring this if I am if I have a smaller purse or I am throwing it in my bag", "but I actually upgraded to", "or I guess you could say downgraded because it is a less expensive planner overall but upgraded in size to the Kate Spade planner", "so that is why got this one recently just to kind of compare the two of these and what the difference would be", "and I like the Kate Spade one because it is bigger", "and I feel like I can do more with it", "so that is why am gonna basically walk you through how I plan I do not have", "it is interesting because the way that my weeks work is I do work Monday through Friday from home", "the majority of the work that I do is from home", "so YouTube", "even though it does not seem like a lot of work I put in a good 45 hours a week for things that are either related to what I do on social media YouTube just everything that is involved in putting out the content that I put out whether it is my blog or", "my any of my YouTube channels anything that I am doing for related to brands like", "if I am working with a particular brand there is a lot that goes into that so almost every day Monday through Friday I have team that I work with that will contact me and say like Oh on Monday they will maybe be like hey this particular brand is interested in working with you next month are you interested in working with them", "and then I will be like", "oh what what do they want to do what is their concept and they will be like", "oh the concept is this they want to collaborate with you on this type of video they like your videos where you do this", "and this is what they were thinking they are like", "can you send over your creative like how would you like to do it", "so that is why send over creative in the neck", "it is approved and there is like a", "there is a lot of back and forth back and forth back and forth", "and so there is a lot that goes on kind of behind the scenes with what I do and what is involved in being a youtuber", "and and the job of being a youtuber", "so I definitely have a lot going on", "but I work mostly from home", "so that is why do put in the hours", "but the way that my weeks work is they kind of start on Monday and everything builds from there", "so what I do is the week before I will sit down with my planner and all usually I never was one of those like decorators", "but then I kind of fell down the rabbit hole of planning one day on YouTube one night and got addicted", "now I do not always I am not like one of those big decorators and people always like I do kind of feel like there is that sense of like who has time to decorate their planner right", "but you it is interesting because you do not realize that like it is actually kind of um what is the word when you do something because it is like relaxing and enjoyable", "and I have never like", "I was", "I have never been a scrapbook or anything like that", "but once I kind of went down the rabbit hole watching YouTube videos of people who play in I got some stickers off of Etsy", "and I was", "like I am gonna decorate my planner like that", "will be really fun", "so I thought it would be fun to just grab a cup of tea and plan with you and have you guys kind of watch what I do", "so here are some stickers I did not pick up a ton", "but I did pick up washi tape which I saw in a bunch of videos I am going to choose this one because this pattern in color looks the most like fall to me", "and I am going to divide the days", "now I have month on glance and", "then", "I also have a week on glance", "and I like to use a week on glance because it helps me just write everything in and see what is going on during the week I also use the little weekend sticker to just divide the weekend", "and I try to keep the weekends for family family", "so I like to divide that on my planner as well", "and then I begin adding fun stickers you know since we are in October and adding some leaves and pumpkins and just making it look fun and fallish and then as we move into the different seasons I will decorate accordingly", "and honestly it takes me like 15 minutes to decorate this", "so I was kind of confused on where to find stickers", "I kind of figured Michaels would have him", "but I actually ordered all of my stuff on Etsy and my friend Hannah likes to play in too", "and she was kind of telling me that that is where she orders her stuff", "so that is why checked it out", "and I got these fun classic fall stickers", "so one thing I learned being a mom is you kind of have to be flexible no week in my household", "is exactly the same", "but I do have certain things that I like to do every single week for instance I like to plan workouts I have voice lessons that I take piano lessons usually on the same day every week depending on our schedule", "I will move it around but on most weeks it stays the same I have certain things we do every week for Oliver and", "those kind of remain the same unless we go on vacation or something major comes up", "so I always start with that what I know I have to do", "and then I add in as things kind of come as the week progresses and we find out there are more things that we have to do", "and then I go through my app for my gym", "and I see what classes are available on the days that I look like I have some free time", "and I will just put those classes in", "I like to take the dance class the choreographer used to work with Beyonce", "and he is good", "so that is why love to try to make that class as often as possible", "I love post its because they are not like as much of a commitment as writing something in your actual planner you can kind of change it around", "so that is why make goals for the day whether that is trying to film a video or do a blog post", "or I have something specific I need to get done on that day", "and it is a priority if I do not get it done", "it is not the end of the world I can move the post it to the next day it did not waste up space in my planner so that is kind of the way I like to do it", "I color code", "so that is why use orange for things that have to do with Oliver blue for things that have to do with Byron and usually black for me or pink", "so it is pretty simple", "I do love this Kate Spade because it does give me more space", "it is a more affordable planner", "it is 40", "it is a little harder to kind of carry around because it is bigger also the other thing that I do is", "these are my gold post its for the month", "so that is why do goal post is for the month and goal post is for every single day and my goal post", "it is basically I will put like every one of my goals for me", "it is all about kind of trying to improve slightly and take baby steps over time", "and that is what my planners help me with because it is really about making goals and then just trying to slowly but surely add things to your schedule so that you are really doing more than you ever thought you could I promise you", "it sometimes you look at people is lives", "and you think how do they do everything", "and it is", "like they really do not they are they know how to prioritize and plan things and schedule things and", "sometimes that is really helpful", "some people are just like off the cuff kind of people and that works for them for me like I just my brain does not work so that is why I have to have a place that I can kind of touch base like home base that is my", "that is my planner that is my little updated planner", "I am NOT the most amazing planner of all time", "but I definitely I hope you guys got some tips from this video", "and I will keep you guys up to date as I kind of changed my planner around but that is pretty much what I do", "so that is why would definitely suggest making little planner post its that is the way I like to do it", "I am a post it freak", "and so that is why you can just kind of like take it off and move it to a different day if you were not able to get it done", "and it is not about getting depressed if you do not reach your goals it is just doing your best to try to accomplish as many things as you can", "in a day when you have all these

about", "so that is why think setting goals and planning things out and planning your week out and seeing it for me I am a very visual person so seeing it is really helpful for me because I am like",

it down on paper", "and I realize", "wow that is like six things I can do that", "like I can get six things done you know", "and even if you do not you are happy and satisfied that you got two or three done so for me", "it is really really helpful", "hopefully you guys enjoyed this video", "let me know what kind of planner you have how you like to plan", "do you like to decorate", "do you do

guys welcome back to my channel", "alright", "so this is a tradition for both my best friend Hannah and I and also on my channel because we have been putting these videos up pretty much ever since I started my channel", "but we have been doing girls night in ever since we were like 10 years old", "so that is why wanted to show you guys a fun", "Halloween version of girls night in", "and I know that women of all ages watch my channel", "but I do not think you are ever too old for a girls night in with your friends um even if you can do it once a year or once every other year so for fall or a Halloween girls night in you", "can invite a lot of friends or your best friend and make some hot apple cider", "so all you need is apple cider from the store one whole orange", "some cinnamon sticks clove and ginger stick it all in the crock pot and let it cook on high for about an hour and a half now feel free to prep this before your friends come", "but it is a delicious treat especially during those fall and winter months so after about an hour and a half I am going to open up the top and begin labeling some of my apple cider into a beautiful cup top it off with some whipped cream", "add a cinnamon stick and some cinnamon on top with an apple slice and you have a delicious warm treat", "okay", "so next we have muddy buddies and beware", "these are dangerously delicious", "so you start with some peanut butter", "most of us know this recipe although I have to say this is the first time I have ever made it", "and I will definitely make it a tradition from now on", "you add", "some butter and chocolate stick it in the microwave and start with 30 seconds at a time until it gets completely smooth", "so once it is microwaved and completely smooth you are going to pull it out start stirring and add the vanilla extract", "mix it all together and then add the Chex cereal you can add pretzels and other things if you like", "but I personally like", "the rice Chex cereal add it in and then you are going to fold in the chocolate and peanut butter and butter", "mixture until it is completely covering the cereal so next you are going to stick it into a bag with powdered sugar and", "you are going to shake shake shake shake shake and", "the reason why you do this is because it is too sticky without the powdered sugar", "the powdered sugar makes it so that you can grab it", "and it does not get all over your hands", "so you are going to shake shake", "shake Hannah", "and I took turns shaking it up", "I find that muddy buddies are really good after they have spent some time in the refrigerator so about an hour or as long as possible then add some Reese is Pieces and some candy corn for the perfect Halloween muddy buddy mix and obviously this mix can be shared but for the time being no boys are allowed except for maybe Oliver if he wakes up so next we wanted to try out a recipe these are the caramel snickerdoodle bites which are pretty easy", "but before we got into these we actually switched the movie from hocus pocus to return to Oz", "now this movie was a favorite of ours growing up", "but it was kind of creepy looking back on it now", "but we preheated the oven to 350 degrees we got these crescent rolls", "and you are just going to hand us actually helping me with this you set them out", "and then this is the easiest recipe of all time you can cut these caramels in half and make them even smaller", "but we added a full sized caramel and wrapped the Crescent dough around the caramel and yes dipped it in sugar and cinnamon", "I am sure you are thinking holy moly", "that is a lot", "but these are different options we all each took a bite of like each thing to taste how they all tasted and they were all delicious but definitely maybe a lot for two people but good ideas if you are having like a Halloween party or", "you are having a lot of girls over or if you are having one friend over you can make one of these things or two of these things", "but these were definitely good once you bake them", "they get nice and crispy", "and then you pull them apart and", "the caramel you can see the caramel and another option I thought would be fun with these is to add some chopped up apples so it is like an apple caramel turnover", "so this is a fun recipe for fall and", "Halloween time so if you are having a party maybe try this out", "they were definitely good so that is why are going to set a timer so that we do not forget these for 12 minutes and next option is a candy and popcorn bar", "now this was really fun and this is an idea if you are having a girls night which is just basically setting out a bunch of different types of candy and popcorn and your guests can add a lot of people like to add candy like inside of the popcorn or make it like a fun movie night", "so there was lots of different options here", "obviously we did not eat all of this", "even so that is why had so much leftovers that I just had to give it away", "but it was so delicious and so fun", "if you are going to have like a little get together some people do not trick or treat some people like to stay and on Halloween", "so this is also a fun idea for that", "hopefully I gave you guys some fun ideas and you enjoyed this video", "you know you are never too old to have a fun girls night and remember what it felt like to kind of be young and

fall", "I add cloves cinnamon sticks and the skin of an orange into water", "and I boil it", "and then I bring it to a simmer", "and I just let it fill the house with the most amazing smell ever I started with this because I wanted the house to smell like fall while I was decorating", "I took a large vaz", "and I took a bunch of different colored pumpkins that you can find it virtually any grocery store right now smaller pumpkins", "and I just filled up the vaz", "these are great little centerpieces I found at Target", "and then I have the pumpkin spice candle from Yankee Candle", "and I put a little burlap string around it to make it a little prettier so that is how I decided to decorate the kitchen", "just pretty minimal these are my favorite candles because they are not sweet they definitely have a more spicy scent", "so it makes the house smell unbelievable so now that I actually have a table I like to do a table scape depending on the season", "it looks pretty so", "of course I have my white hydrangeas which look good with any season", "and I made those mason jar bosses in a previous video I am going to add some white pumpkins I got this great little wood holder on Etsy", "it was homemade", "and then these pumpkins I got at Target", "and then I am gonna make some DIY pumpkins so that is why am going to take the smaller white pumpkins I have some glue", "and I am going to brush the glue on the tops of the pumpkin", "and then I am going to add some glitter you cut a hole for the tea light to go in there", "and then you have these great little tea light holders

cool thing about decorating is obviously this is my style", "but you could totally change it and customize it to represent you your taste in your style and", "that is the great thing about decorating you kind of have to be creative you can even add different color sprinkles or sparkles if you like that and kind of make it your own", "so now it is time to decorate the front door", "and I am going to show you how to make it easy", "do it yourself monogram pumpkin like", "so easy", "okay", "so first I like to get seasonal plants from Home Depot", "and then I got this great sign off of", "Etsy again homemade", "I found these lanterns online and then these candles at Target and they are actually faux candle", "so they flicker", "and they look like real candles", "but they are not so that is why can keep them outside", "and they are safe last year", "i decorated some pumpkins on the blog and this year I wanted to show you how to make a super easy do it yourself monogram pumpkin", "now I could not find a large white pumpkin around where I live", "so I spray painted a pumpkin you can spray paint", "it gold any color you want", "and you can get", "these monogram stickers at Michael is and you literally just peel it and stick it on", "and it looks like you spent forever adding one beat at a time", "but you did not", "and it is it looks great in the front so again adding the lantern

it", "I think it looks beautiful and the next I am going to show you how to make a do it yourself a leaf frame and just finishing touches on the house", "so if you find a great leaf walking around your neighborhood feel free to use that", "but since we do not have too many leaves this color around my neighborhood", "I got some silk ones at Michaels and", "you are just going to place it inside a clear frame I like these wooden frames", "they are really rustic looking and kind of go with my style", "and it is literally the easiest DIY ever", "but it is so fun for fall and", "the great thing is is that you can keep the frame obviously and add a picture you know for Christmas or whatever", "but in the fall you could add your leaves", "and it is a nice festive do it yourself", "and then I got this great happy fall", "ya will pillow on Etsy as well", "and I add a fun festive pillow to my couch and that pretty much completes how I decorate for fall hopefully you guys enjoyed this video do

going to be a little bit of a mommy video", "I was in an inspirational mood inspired mood to try to be a Pinterest mom", "now let me just say I have tried my fair share of Pinterest ideas I do love Pinterest", "I got into Pinterest", "laughs", "well now when I was pregnant I got really into Pinterest because that is pretty much all I could do", "was sit on the couch and look through Pinterest", "all the time so that was like the extent of like my ambition when I was pregnant", "was Pinterest and I pinned a bunch of things I wanted to do and try when Oliver was a baby when he got a little bit older", "I think with Pinterest", "you never know how it is going to turn out it never turns out as amazing for me as it does for the Pinterest pictures that I have pin", "so I did want to try a few fun things to do with kids", "my mom did a lot of projects with us when we were kids like art projects and she encouraged creativity and every time you know a new season would roll around she would like decorate the house and include us and we would make all sorts of like homemade platos and different things", "and so that is definitely something I want to implement as a mother really encouraging a fun creative environment in my home and something", "where Oliver is just encouraged to express that side of him", "and you know I enjoyed it too", "so that is why wanted to share with you some of the Pinterest ideas that I had that I kind of recreated and made my own and also my grades", "what I graded them after I tried them out for myself so hopefully you guys will enjoy this video and we will just do not okay", "so let is start with the crayons", "so now this idea looked fun to me all it took", "was melting some glycerin soap which you can get at Michael", "is you want to microwave it in 15 second increments making sure that the soap does not burn", "so that is why pull it out", "you stir it a little bit until it is completely melted now that you have your melted soap", "it is time to add the coloring now this coloring is completely safe because it is soap coloring now", "the downside to this recipe is that some people may not like to use that on their kids", "and I totally get that I think the concept for soap crayons are to be more fun and playful and colorful and not necessarily to wash your body with", "so that was going to be my approach for it", "I made multiple different colors I tried to add a lot of soap coloring so that it looked really deep because I was not sure how effective the cran was gonna be when drawing in the bathtub", "so that is why did not have the molds that they had on Pinterest", "but I did have these molds", "so that is why thought that these would be fun", "they are kind of like seashells", "maybe colored seashell crayons you can kind of make it with whatever molds that you have", "but I definitely wanted to try these out and see how they work I stuck these in the fridge for a few hours", "and then they were ready to go super colorful", "I did allow Oliver to use these in the bath and my biggest complaint was that they kept slipping out of his hands and they did not really color that great", "I will say though that when he was playing with these in his highchair he liked him a little bit more and they are definitely fun maybe more enjoyable for kids who are older so the color payoff for these was not amazing", "and they kept slipping out of his hands in the bathtub so that is why have to give this project a b minus", "although maybe something fun for older kids", "okay let is try some colored slime which I totally remember from the 90s", "this is actually pretty easy", "all you need is psyllium husks", "now this is like Metamucil or", "you can find this at any drugstore and you are going to also use food coloring so that is why are going to mix one tablespoon of clear fiber supplement to one cup of water so that is why can add any type of food coloring that you want", "but I definitely recommend going light on the color", "the more you add the more likely it will be to bleed on your hands when you are playing with it", "that was kind of one of the downsides so it does come out pretty easily with soap and water", "but that is", "something to keep in mind you want to give it a good mix and microwave for five minutes be sure to keep an eye on it because it will bubble over", "so I made this in a few different colors I added the fiber supplement to water", "microwaved it for five minutes as you can see it is starting to bubble up there", "and you will see that", "it after being microwaved it kind of has this really unique slimy texture and consistency", "and it pulls away from the container", "so I made this in four different colors and it is very hot when it first comes out so you can make this with older kids but for my son", "I made this when he was napping", "and I waited for it to cool down before I showed it to him or let him play with it as it cools down", "it kind of creates an even more sticky slimy feel to it", "but it is much more", "it is", "less wet it is", "it is more movable", "so that is why put this in the container", "and I stored it away", "the biggest downside to this was that the cooler it got the harder", "it got and also it definitely had a little bit of payoff on our hands", "which is pretty easy to wash off with soap and water", "but it can be kind of a mess", "so that is why did find it really interesting", "and it definitely kept his attention for a little bit", "but I would have to give this project a C just because I do not think it was the cleanest project to work with", "so this project is a twist on a childhood favorite of mine and that is play doh", "this is not difficult to make it all", "I love making play doh because it is completely non toxic and actually edible so it is the perfect DIY for kids because they might stick it in the mouth so starting with one tablespoon of olive oil to 2 3 cup of water I am going to bring it to a boil in a separate bowl I am going to add one cup of flour 1 4 cup of salt and 1 kool aid packet once the water has come to a boil you are going to slowly add it to your dry mixture and mix it all together", "and you are going to mix it until it creates the playdough consistency now", "I wish you could smell this because it smells like kool aid and kool aid smells amazing", "this is rich with cherry scent it smells so good", "I almost ate it to be honest and", "I also made a great version play doh is a fun thing for kids of all ages starting even as young as my son 20 months and even if they stick a little bit in their mouth it is not harmful and usually they spit it out because of the salt I took it and stored it in these little containers I got at Michaels", "and you can store this and bring it out for playtime", "it lasts I would say for a few weeks", "and then I think you want to throw it away", "this is a great project to make with older kids who will enjoy the process", "but it is just a sensory experience for children like my son", "is age and you can make different shapes", "and you can encourage them to do it", "and it is fun", "and it kept him busy for a long time so out of all the projects I made I think that this one is the most classic and my favorite if you have not already definitely try this with your kids", "it is a classic DIY recipe for moms and kids", "so it gets an a plus for me", "finally we have do it yourself sensory water bottles", "these are so fun", "they are just really fun to look at and they are great for toddlers", "especially so it is very stimulating", "there is no exact recipe it is just one of those projects you can totally have fun with", "so that is why started filling half of my water container my watertight container with blue water that I used food coloring", "with I topped the container off with some vegetable oil", "and then I added some glitter and just some fun beads and jewels from Michael is", "and then I made one in green as well", "and you can do you could put whatever you want in there", "I think the key is to have the oil and water mixture", "and you can mess around with the food coloring because I had to go a little light with it so that you could see the items inside of the water bottle if you have a young child and you are concerned about them opening it up", "you can definitely hot glue gun the top so that they cannot open it or that you are monitoring them when they are playing with it because there can be some items in there that they could possibly choke on", "but I definitely watched Oliver play with it", "and he was so enamored with it", "and it was definitely a fun project if children are monitored while playing with this", "I definitely would give this an A because he found this really fascinating", "and I think you can make it with larger bottles and have a lot of fun as that you could totally play around with it and make it your own", "and it is definitely a fun project for kids", "hope you enjoyed this video if you did please thumbs up this video and subscribe to my channel for more videos like this", "check out my

morning and", "at night to kind of beautify", "okay", "so let is start with the a m", "now I have done a video in the past where I showed me taking a shower in the morning", "and sometimes I do sometimes", "I do not", "but when I do not take a shower I use these facial radiance pads by first aid beauty they are really brightening they are perfect for first thing in the morning", "then I have been using for the moisturizer this is called in transit close up", "this is by a company called this works", "I love it because it is multi purpose", "and it doubles as my moisturizer and my primer so it leaves a nice tacky sticky feeling on the skin which in this case is great because it allows my tinted moisturizer to stay on the skin all day long on most days I am usually using a tinted moisturizer like this one from Sean Takai", "this is called skin and this was recommended to me by a makeup artist", "it is kind of a pricey option", "so there are definitely options that are more affordable", "but I wanted to try it out", "and I have been loving it", "it is like a second skin on the skin", "and it is just beautiful you", "it is almost like you are not wearing anything", "and I love products like that", "so whether it is worth the price or not I do not know", "I guess it kind of depends", "but I have been loving it", "and I use my Beauty Blender to just blend it in nice and perfectly", "I do not always wear eyeshadow", "but I have been kind of feeling eyeshadow lately so that is why use my Naked basics that is pretty much the only eyeshadow I actually do use", "and I am using this brown to kind of define my eyes", "and then of course I am gonna pump out my lashes with my favorite Tarte mascara", "I would say nude lip liner is definitely a daily used makeup product of mine and I have mentioned it in so many of my videos because my makeups pretty redundant to be completely honest but the NARS orgasm is what I mentioned in my previous video one of my Holy Grail products and I apply a little blush sometimes bronzer if I am feeling it", "but that is usually all I do", "and then I", "my vez cal morning supplement", "this is helping my hair grow and it has really been helping", "I also mentioned that in my Holy Grail products so that is pretty much what I do in the morning now at night is when I have all the fun I have been testing out a bunch of different shampoos and conditioners", "I got some new shampoo and conditioner from Kiehl is", "and I got the Oribe", "but I do really like this head and shoulders too and one it smells like watermelon", "and it just I feel like when I switch shampoos and go to a different shampoo", "it makes my hair oily", "but I know some people are not a fan of Head Shoulders I have been liking it",

most nights I use a moisturizer like this one from Kate Somerville", "this is the nourish", "this is great for all skin types it smells like lavender", "and then sometimes I put a few drops of the midnight recovery concentrate by Kiehl", "is over my moisturizer and this also really smells like lavender", "it is calming it is made from essential oils and it does give the skin some tone and glow and it does not make me break out", "so that is why like this product I just got this creme", "de corpse Kiehl is moisturizer", "this is the body moisturizer", "but I have used this in the past before I like it", "it is a lightweight body moisturizer", "so it is not like the oil and well a task in food that I normally use", "but it is a little bit lighter for the hotter months", "and then I would say once a week or whenever I am in the mood I do a nighttime facial", "and this is really fun for me", "I usually do different options", "so option one is a deep exfoliating treatment and I will usually use a facial sauna which I actually just got this", "I had one forever ago", "and then it broke", "and then I used a bowl with hot water and put my face over it", "and then I got one of these", "and then I use the gentle exfoliate by Kate Somerville after I have steamed the skin so that opens up the pores and really allows the mask to do its job", "and then I go back over the sauna and let it steam again while the mask is on my face", "and then I wash it off this particular face", "steamer offers a cold option which is great for after a mask because it closes the pores with cool steam so this is also a great option that I use if I am feeling like I want a battle sun damage or hyperpigmentation", "right now I actually have a spot on my cheek from picking a pimple I will use something like this", "this is the fast blast vitamin C mask", "it is oxygenating and", "it is extremely brightening to the skin so what I am looking to battle any sun damage or hyperpigmentation", "I always recommend this product and also I use it myself", "and then the third option is a treatment for inflamed or irritated skin", "now I would never do all of these treatments in one night", "you can layer treatments if you want", "but you want to go based on how your skin is looking and how your skin is feeling", "so that is why would save these sheet masks for a night when my skin feels dry", "inflamed", "maybe I got a sunburn I am feeling irritated", "this is really calming", "and then I will sit with that on now products that I love just for fun a few of these I have already mentioned in the past this one I mentioned in my Holy Grail products", "I got probably about eight six to eight of these for three dollars on Amazon", "these are gel lip masks and they basically just hydrate your lips and you can keep them on for you know 20 minutes", "or so while you are watching a movie I will use those or the gel masks under my eye I also like to use the new face whenever I get

expensive shampoo and conditioner", "and it was not working", "it was making my hair oily he bought the two in one dry scalp care head and shoulders", "and so that is why started using this", "and I was like", "that is what I have to do", "I ca not use shampoo and conditioner separately for me", "I have to use a two in one", "and it is been really helping so that my hair does not look as oily and

saying I have tried so many different products", "and I was not 100 happy with all the ones that I was using I", "just did not see so many", "I did not see amazing results", "but I got these vivid

deal with hair that is what I have been using", "I have been keeping it really simple with shampoo and conditioner if you have hair like mine that looks is maybe fine and", "you are kind of thinner

favorite that I have ever tried this has been my favorite mask", "this is the m61 powerful skin care", "fast blast two minute vitamin C facial mask", "it is like an oxygenating mask", "so that is why

both of the probes", "but this one is from new face", "I originally had the mini", "but I did not like the mini quite as much as I like this", "this is called the Trinity and the Trinity has three different attachments", "so I started using the facial toning device for multiple reasons for just curiosity because I like these types of devices but also to see if it really worked I like this one because like I said it has the different attachments so that is why used this one for around the eye right here where my jowls are", "and you can definitely feel it", "and then I use this one", "I put

LED light machine I am all about the convenience and to me that is way easier", "I have an LED light machine that I never pull out and use this it does not have to be plugged in you", "charge it on a little charger", "and then you are good to go", "so I do all three treatments I do all three attachments before I go to bed", "this is awesome", "I am actually going to be giving one of these away so

effect", "and it is delicious now for me", "I have worked it up to the point where I do not need to add any additional sugar but for some people they want to add some honey or agave or whatever

my youtube channel", "and I had goals to like grow my channel and make it a business that was one thing that I did", "and it did help once you have made goals the next tip is to remind yourself daily

accomplishing them", "try not to make your goals too big", "make them something realistic if you think that saying I am going to get up every single day and run four miles if you feel like you can

collaboration with entertaining with Beth", "this is a fun series that we are doing to kind of get you guys prepped for summer get together parties whatever you have planned coming up", "we thought it would be fun to collaborate put our heads together", "so if you are having people over and you are not sure what to serve them definitely go check out her channel after I am done with this video and you can find some easy and quick ways to feed your guests so today I am going to be sharing with you my tips on how to get your space in tip top shape for your next party or get together even if it is last minute", "so let is jump right in my first tip is to evaluate the type of get together that you are having if you are having a lot of people over and there are certain rooms that are not as clean", "or you do not have time to get it organized", "and you d rather have them not go in there", "you can just simply close those doors and most guests", "will kind of get the hint it is also a great tip if you are having a last minute get together because you do not have to clean the entire house", "my next tip is to prepare and when you prepare it is preparing for the worst thing that could happen when you have a bunch of guests over so that is why like to have stain removals on hand because people are hanging out maybe dropping drinks and you can make a homemade one with vinegar and about 20 drops of essential oils", "a spot cleaner is definitely something you should have around your house in general", "but when you are having get together and you are gonna have more foot traffic people could be spilling drinks you do not want to feel overly paranoid so that is why have to have you know the proper essentials", "and you just spray it and Pat it with a wet cloth and just let it dry", "and it will be gone", "my next tip is I actually picked up a bunch of these kind of chalkboards for around the house", "and I am going to keep them", "I am gonna whip them out whenever I have a special event or a get together", "you know first and foremost the large one", "I am just gonna write welcome", "but if you are having a bridal shower or a baby shower you can kind of go all out and", "you can customize it", "so what I did was", "I just got a little stand", "and I put it right when you enter into my house", "but you can get a larger stand and put it outside", "you can totally customize it", "and so that is what I love about the chalkboard ideas", "so we also picked up some of the really small chalkboards and these are for hanging up and", "what I liked about these were a", "they were four dollars", "and I thought that they would make really great labels for the bathroom for the coat closet for the room that you want them to put their purses in so that is why can close the doors of the rooms that you do not want them to go into or you can leave the doors open", "it is totally your preference if you want people to be able to go into every single room depending on the size of your get together", "but it is always kind of difficult to tell every single person who comes in where the bathrooms are where they can put their purses and coats so that is why loved this I just took some thin rope and put it looped it through", "and then I am just gonna hang that on the doors", "and you can just let your guests know that there will be signs to help guide them for where the restroom is and where they can put their purses and coats you so in general whenever I am cleaning my house I always start by removing clutter because clutter can give a spotless house a messy appearance very quickly", "and you know you want to give your guests room to move freely about your house", "so that is why remove obviously baby toys", "any you know leftover mails shoes keys anything that is kind of unsightly", "I put everything in its place", "I fluffed the pillows", "and I kind of declutter", "next we get into the actual cleaning so sometimes for me it helps to start in a certain area", "so that is why begin cleaning from the entryway of my house", "and I kind of work my way through the places that I know my guests will spend the majority of their time in", "so that is why know the living space", "the kitchen", "I am obviously gonna clean the counters in the bathroom", "and you want to kind of focus on the areas that they are going to be spending the majority of their time in", "I saved that cleaning container", "it is actually an all natural recipe that I will have on my blog for you in case", "you are interested so that is why think

my guests choose whether they want to keep their shoes on or take them off", "but I always have socks just in case they like to take their shoes off", "and I do have tile floor", "so it makes it more comfortable one of my favorite finishing touches is flowers", "and I like to have them in my house as often as possible but especially if I am having a party or guests over", "I think it is a pretty finishing touch", "and if I know I am gonna be going to the store to pick up some ingredients I will pick up a bouquet of flowers only because I feel like they are a little bit more symmetrical", "and it makes for a prettier arrangement", "but you could most definitely pick flowers out of your garden or your backyard and make an arrangement for your table for your bathroom especially for the guest bathroom I always like to put an arrangement in there I do like to put out", "fresh hand towels freshly washed hand towels I have traditional soap", "but", "I also have a soap dispenser", "I have some disposable hand towels as well in case", "my guests prefer that", "and then I do keep some potpourri in there", "I keep a basket in my guest bathroom full of toiletries", "and I usually collect these small toiletries when I am traveling at various hotels", "so that is why have lotion I have shampoo and conditioner in case they are spending the night", "ear swabs tampons", "little soaps hand towels anything I think that they will need or that will make them feel more comfortable", "I always put extra toilet paper right there where they can see it", "so they do not have to search through drawers", "or you know look through cabinets or anything", "and it just makes it easy for your guests hopefully you guys enjoyed my tips and tricks for your next get together or party and do not

love this", "it is amazing", "it really brightens up your skin and it is like an oxygenating foaming mask", "so that is why put that on for two minutes while I am waiting for that I am going to do a

last one", "so far I have been absolutely loving", "Oribe makes your hair incredibly soft and shiny but it is definitely pricey so that is why usually use drugstore shampoo and conditioner", "but I

removal permanent soon", "but I do still shave", "and then I am using the Fiji body scrub which smells amazing", "it smells like", "a pina colada makes your skin soft and leaves a nice oil residue on

drying", "so I am not a pro at blow drying my hair but over the years", "I have learned how I like to do it", "I start by fingering through my hair with the hair blow dryer", "and then I use a paddle brush or my traditional hair brush", "and then I use the Kate Somerville lumi white serum underneath my moisturizer", "this is really good for hyperpigmentation and just overall even skin tone", "and then I am using the ponds anti wrinkle cream which I think is an amazing dupe for lemare it is hydrating it really does plump out the wrinkles so it is awesome", "and then I am going to separate my hair", "I am going to Flatiron the bottom portion because my hair is naturally wavy", "and then for today I am going to keep the top normal so that I have a little bit of volume left in my hair", "and

getting dolled up because it is more it is bright", "and it is", "kind of it is dramatic for sure", "but it does kind of soak into my skin after about an hour", "and it looks really good", "so at first it is always kind of white and strong looking", "but I am going to use a bronzer to a contour", "I guess is the right word contour", "and I am using my brush the eita brush by NARS I am using the Naked palette the small baby one", "and I am going to use a little bit of brown to give my eyes a little bit more definition", "okay", "so that is why am using the Anastacio highlighter pencil

professional makeup artist saying I am using this stuff called brow food which has little extensions and some color", "so it just really evens out my eyebrows makes them look pretty", "I am going to use Tarte mascara which is the best mascara and then the NARS eyeliner I am using that to tightline all the way around my eye just to kind of give my eyes a little bit more of a pop", "I normally have small kind of non existent almond eyes", "so whatever I can do to make them look a little bit bigger I am using the stripped down lip liner from Mac which is great", "it is beauty", "it is a beautiful

little strip so the same is with the tray", "you are gonna paint it once let it dry paint it again let it dry overnight", "and then remove the tape in the morning to reveal this strip that your guests

targeted needs that is where serum comes in a lot of people think that serum is just like a layering thing", "but it is actually not", "your serums are a smaller molecular weight so that is why are going to penetrate the skin better and because you are putting them underneath something that occlusive layer or moisturizer on top will actually increase the penetration as well so that is why they are more targeted and specific regarding", "you know concerns", "you know they can be hydrating anti aging reparative your moisturizer is there to lubricate and condition the surface of the skin and protect everything else all that you just put on from escaping I have extremely dry skin like chronically dry any product recommendations I have tried so many things and nothing works", "okay", "well that could be a couple things that can definitely be environmental so if you are in a dry climate one of the first things I say to people if you have had no luck with product get a humidifier", "I was gonna say that minifiers the best makes a big different you do like the cool or the warm one", "um I would think the warm that is my thought would probably be a little bit better", "and then I would say to up your level of water that you are drinking you could also get one of the showerhead filter the metals and minerals in the gross mess of the pipes and everything can have an effect on your skin you need to exfoliate a little bit if you are flaky though", "and you do not need to get in there", "and like you know not stand on a table", "but or a really basic exfoliator", "but then I always say to make sure you are doing like a nice hydrating serum or gel under your moisturizer because it could be that your moisturizer is not giving enough hydration meaning it has enough water in it to go into the skin", "so use a hydrating gel or seer underneath your moisturizer and then look into facial oils", "you know you want to o that you are removing all that dry flaky skin before you

and", "it is kind of you ca not use", "I felt like I kind of had to let my skin do its thing because I could not use the products I wanted to when I was pregnant so", "at that point it was a matter of just eating healthy drinking lots of water taking care of yourself and kind of riding the waves less is more", "definitely less is more with pregnancy and even my clients who come and", "I am like well you are pregnant", "we ca not do much well and for your like for your tummy", "I did a lot of dry brushing", "and I had like exfoliating", "and so that is why would like it is because you are not supposed to eat your tummy", "so that is why would like exploit with those gloves", "and I ended up not getting any stretch marks because I was like really every single day I would exfoliate and like put layers of oil away away", "I used a few", "I used the Elemis Japanese Camilla oil", "I think it was called", "and then I had a mama mia one", "and I would like rotate", "I literally was like basking in oil", "I was like", "okay", "then I d like to put a huge robot next to trail", "literally row is going 100 natural on skincare good or should you balance prescription and natural products well by natural products if you mean my homemade", "I would not say go on that I had someone the other day who like all they were using was like mayonnaise an avocado and natural is not always better

that word out and we are find something that just is works more with your skin out of the ingredients that spurred these natural products come out people avoid putting in products", "now favors",

just adding it all together", "there are some recipes made with these three ingredients alone", "but I felt that it added to the flavor to have a little bit of almond milk and a little bit of vanilla

weed killer you", "it is really easy", "you can make a do it yourself one those two things can kind of help in the beginning process because bugs and weeds kind of get in the way", "and then it is hard to find something that is natural to kind of repel them", "the other thing is that when you are first starting to plant you sometimes forget which ones which so that is why made these little markers these are DIY markers that you can put so for instance I am planning citrus trees the citrus does not grow right away you do not have citrus right away so for a few months you know the little markers will help remind you like you know which tree or which plant", "you have another great tip", "is to make a watering schedule we are in a drought right now in California", "so that is why have to reduce my water not taking showers and kind of being mindful about how much water I use but also with my plants", "you know I am either buying fruit that is being watered", "or I can you know be mindful of the water I am using and kind of grow some of my own vegetation so that I do not have to buy it from the market", "so that is why am saving money and hopefully in the long run saving water so creating a water schedule so that you do not over water so that Byron does not end up watering when I was supposed to water or whatever creating a water schedule is great", "and if you start having more and more plants you do need a watering schedule to remind you which plants need watering and and so on and so forth", "so I had a lot of indoor plants when I lived in my apartment because I liked it", "and you know some plants if you do some research can filter the air", "and it is actually really beneficial to have plants I feel like not", "do they make you feel happier because you have something living in your house", "so I love to have flowers", "the plants are something that are always recommended to kind of fill empty spaces and houses when you are designing and there is a movie

matter of kind of learning about it", "and it is", "it is almost like taking on a hobby", "and I think it takes a little bit of kind of learning about your plant", "and then you kind of become

burlap sign I am going to take an old wrapping paper tube", "and I am going to wrap the burlap over it and then cut it accordingly so that it fits perfectly underneath", "then I am going to take some ribbon and loop it through and over tie a knot and then go ahead and hang it", "and you know it is not like the most amazing craft ever", "but I thought it was cute and simple and that is", "kind of what I was going for my front door", "was feeling a little empty and not as inviting as I would like it to", "so that is why decided to get some lavender and pot that lavender", "so that is why bought

it", "and so just basically creating a bigger version of that", "and then I got this great vaz metal container at HomeGoods for super cheap", "I love home goods", "I can find the best things and", "I am putting some hydrangeas from the grocery store", "I am gonna trim them a little bit like take out some of the leaves and prune it", "and then around it I am gonna wrap some burlap and make a pretty little bow", "but I wanted to add some bulk to the front of my door so that it felt very inviting very warm and kind of something to look at", "and I think a home really represents who you are it really shows people who you are", "and so that is the first thing that they see you so next I am going to do some egg decorating these", "are actually blown out eggs so that is why do not have anything in them", "so these are solely for the purpose of decorating and I am basically putting glitter", "I have a pen", "so that is why can kind of glue whatever you want whether it is polka dots

order it and my local florist delivered it to me", "so it is fabulous", "and then I am going to put those decorated eggs in some moss underneath the arrangement and the appetizers are going to go here", "and so it is going to be a beautiful arrangement to look at", "and then I am also going to take some tulips that I got from the grocery store and kind of put them around the house on the

all the way to the top so that you can just see the green sticking out and", "these are going to look like little carrots for the Easter Bunny", "so that is why thought that this was a fun Easter decoration slash dessert", "and I had to do it", "so I thought I would give you a little preview of the makeup that I am gonna do on Easter Sunday which is not too far from what I do every single day which I use the steel SEC cream to kind of even out my skin tone", "and I put that everywhere", "and then I use concealer YSL Touche clot", "is a great concealer for under your eyes or if you have a breakout or anything like that", "and then I always wear mascara", "I think it just brightens up the eyes and it makes you look more awake especially as a mom if you are not getting as many hours of sleep as you want mascara", "is the one thing that I think can make a difference this is tart tipsy which i think is the perfect Spring Fling flirty color I love it", "and then for lips I am using

always want to cleanse both morning and night and", "as we learned in my facial video with Greg it is important to cleanse before giving yourself a facial", "so today I wanted to choose a cleanser that is an oil cleanser", "I know for me", "I was always really intimidated by the idea of oil cleansers for the longest time", "but it is really important that you do not strip your skin of its natural oils and an oil cleanser", "is great in balancing the oil levels", "even people with oily skin can use oil cleansers because the good oil attracts the bad oil and can really properly cleanse your skin without stripping it my second tip is to give yourself a steam facial I love to add lavender or lavender oil in a bowl of burning hot water", "be careful of course I do this when my sons asleep so that nobody gets hurt", "but you can put your head in there", "put a towel over and let your skin steam you will often see steam treatments available in spas because steam helps to loosen the cellular cement that binds our dead skin cells to the surface", "so it makes your skin appear fresher and younger", "looking my next tip is to make your own exfoliant", "they can be expensive so all you need is baking soda", "some milk which has lactic acid Ramanuja honey and I like to use lavender amino acids are the building blocks of collagen and since manuka honey contains lots of amino acids this is going to help give your skin a healthy and firm and youthful appearance so that is why love to make a scrub with these ingredients what I also love is that as you start to mix the scrub together it will kind of start to puff up because of the baking soda", "the baking soda acts as a nice granulated exfoliant so instead of using a chemical exfoliant like glycolic acid or malic acid which i have spoken about in the past you are using a physical", "then you are also getting the benefits of the lactic acid in the milk the manuka honey benefits and lavender which is also excellent for your skin", "it is best to make a fresh batch of this exfoliant every time you make it because of the chemical reaction that occurs when mixing these ingredients together with baking soda", "so that is why love this DIY exfoliant", "and it is there is a lot of different recipes I have put up on my blog before of different types of exfoliants", "but this one is nice if you are trying to prevent aging and see a reduction in fine lines and wrinkles especially over time", "and it is cheaper too so that always helps", "so I think most people would agree that you should use an anti wrinkle cream if you are concerned with wrinkles and I thought that this one was an excellent choice", "I also liked that it came with these applicators so that is why can actually test to see if it is made a difference in your wrinkles it contains AAAS or alpha hydroxy acids which help remove dull surface skin to reduce the appearance of fine lines so a chaise are great to look for in an anti wrinkle cream also vitamin E which I have talked about before because it is an antioxidant known to soothe and promote healthier skin I have been using this cream consistently for two weeks", "and I

squeeze some lime for some flavor and then also I am going to put some olive oil", "the olive oil actually prevents it from sticking once it comes time to grilling it so that is why am going to add that olive oil on there and take it on out to the grill and grill once that salmon is all grilled", "it is time to plate so that is why am going to have the fresh fluffy rice down on the plate first and make like a little mound", "and then put the salmon on top of that", "and then some mango salsa over that I am just gonna try to plate it and make it look a little presentable with some cilantro

customize to whatever your skintone currently is", "so it is helpful", "the only color I do not use a whole lot of is this yellow tone but other skin tones would probably like that it is just a great kit for contouring so if you have been in the market for a good contouring color or two colors obviously because you want to highlight", "and then you want a contour color", "this is great because you have lots of different shades to work with and customize for your own perfect contour", "so I have been loving this", "I have actually been experimenting with lipsticks a little bit more lately", "and you know it is something that I never did that much of I", "used to kind of be a gloss girl and wear gloss and that was it", "and I kind of go through phases with lipstick", "but lately I have been pairing a few different colors my first pair that I really like", "and I am actually wearing right now", "is the NARS Turkish delight and the Mac Saint Germain now NARS reformulated their Turkish delight I had never purchased the Turkish Delight before because I heard it was sticky and gooey and just not a good lip gloss", "but this one is the reformulated one", "and I like it", "I would say my con to it is that it it does not have a good like scent you know or taste", "but I do love the color so this particularly looks pretty with the Saint Germain which is like a Barbie pink by Mac

seriously way too expensive", "but I want to eat it", "every single time I put it on it literally tastes like a grapefruit candy drop and it is the perfect sheer very mild gloss", "so it is not quite

are wearing anything it almost kind of looks like a matte pomade kind of look to the hair", "it is the perfect matte dry texturizing hairspray so if you are in the market for something like that

care of your canvas I call it your canvas", "I believe that if you take care of your skin you do not even need to wear makeup on most days you will feel confident enough to walk out without makeup and there are some basic tips and tricks that I have learned over the years to taking care of your skin and", "even if I change up my products all the time which a lot of times I do the basic regime stays the same and I wanted to share my tips what I believe works for taking care of your skin now", "I am not a dermatologist", "I am not even an esthetician but working in the industry", "I learned so

gentle oil cleansers can actually be used all over the entire face", "but I use it around my eyes", "and then I use a traditional cleanser something really mild", "but it is important to cleanse your skin both morning and night especially before you go to bed", "you do not want to be sleeping in makeup", "so the next step is something you will hear kind of mixed reviews on and that is toning", "but at the end of the day toning balances your pH levels", "and it does remove any additional grime that you may have missed when you are cleansing when it comes to step 4 and moisturizing", "it is important to keep in mind that you may have a different routine in the morning than you do at night in the day", "it is really about protecting your skin from the harsh elements and one way to do that", "is with an antioxidant rich face cream if I have a simple day cream that does not include vitamin C which is an excellent antioxidant I will use this vitamin C booster powder by philosophie", "it gives a fresh dose of vitamin C which brightens the skin", "evens out the skin tone tightens the skin and overall makes it look very healthy so it is a great product to use in the day", "and then obviously it is very important to protect your skin from the Sun and", "using a sunscreen is a great way to do that", "but sunscreens can be kind of heavy sometimes", "and you know greasy and the traditional sunscreens that we know of do not often feel breathable to the skin my solution to that is using a liquid sunscreen or a serum sunscreen they work so much better than the traditional sunscreen at night", "you are gonna want to use some sort of serum with hyaluronic acid", "do not let the word acid scare you because hyaluronic acid is not harsh or stripping to the skin at all", "it is actually a powerful humectant that is basically a moisture binding ingredient that plumps out your skin and makes it look extra healthy my fifth and favorite step that I do at nighttime", "and this can only be done at nighttime is using a retinol or retinol retinol", "is only available through your doctor and it is extremely strong it can actually make you peel", "and it is like almost kind of like a face peel but retinol is available over the counter retinas and retinol increase cell turnover in the skin making your skin look", "younger healthier clearer makes your pores look smaller", "it is basically life changing so", "that is why have to trust me and try a retinol", "and then if you feel so inclined move up to a retina if you feel like your skin needs it so that completes this

is my all time favorite", "I actually found out about it a few years ago when I worked at Sephora and I have been addicted ever since it uses a natural moisturizers not synthetic ones so it does not weigh my hair down which is perfect because I have kind of fine hair", "and it is a simple step that makes my hair look a billion times better", "so that is why evenly distribute that with my tangle teezer this brush is perfect for using on wet hair because it does not pull out too much hair", "and then I am gonna blow dry my hair 50 of the way and let the rest dry naturally for my messy updo I like a multi purpose beauty balm when I am getting ready it acts as multiple beauty products", "so it saves you time", "and it saves you money and", "that is great if you do not have a lot of time",

then I am gonna fill in my brows", "this is something that I did not do for a really long time", "and I realized that when you even your brows out and you fill them in it complements the face so it is a great idea to fill in your brows and obviously mascara is so", "on my word it is my favorite beauty product if I had to live on an island with one beauty product", "it would be mascara", "but I am curious", "what yours would be so leave that in the comments below okay", "so the next step is cheeks and lips again with the multi purpose products I am using an aluminized blush so it is easy to go crazy with beauty products you can have blushes and", "then illuminizer x", "but I like to use multi purpose products", "so I am gonna do that", "and then my nails are red so that is why thought it

a bold lip next", "I need an easy and quick hairstyle so that is why am gonna use a texturizing spray first in my hair to kind of get my hair texture obviously", "this is a dry hairspray so it helps with that if you want that like beachy wave", "and I am actually gonna turn that blow dryer", "and I am gonna get the volume going in my hair because I am gonna do a messy bun updo", "and yes I have got all the volume look at that", "but it was blow dried 50 of the way and", "a little bit at the end for volume I am gonna take my hair put it up and are simple like cheerleader ponytail", "and then I am gonna swish that around and put a bobby pin or two bobby pins depending on how many your hair needs", "and it is a quick easy pull together sheep looking", "bun", "I think it looks cute", "but it

bed", "so I called the doctor at around 5 o clock in the morning he called me back", "I told him you know", "hey I had like a liquid coming out of me", "and he said you need to come into the delivery room", "I had", "my hospital bags packed", "I pretty much had everything ready to go for the most part with the exception of like a few little things that I wanted to get", "and", "and I I was pretty prepared because I kind of had this vibe this feeling that he was going to come early", "and I felt like I needed to be prepared", "so we got our hospital bag", "we packed the car and", "we went and",

room", "and they began to kind of check if I had dilated if I was you know effaced if you know like the normal signs of labor", "and I was not dilated", "I", "you know there was like nothing I was having contractions like every 15 minutes or 10 minutes", "it was", "and I could not even feel them so that is why were not sure what was going on", "they tested the fluid and it was not showing up his amniotic fluid so that is why was thinking I am gonna be going home right", "they are gonna send me home", "I was even texting Nikki saying let is go to Victoria Secret they were having a sale they were having the Victoria is Secret annual sale or whatever I was like let is go to the sale", "let is get our nails done today because I am probably gonna be sent home within an hour and a half so the doctor came in", "and he said you know the test is coming back negative", "it is not amniotic fluid", "you are not dilated", "you know there is really no signs", "but we are going to check your amniotic fluid via an ultrasound", "so that is why did an ultrasound and my amniotic fluid was low and at that point that kind of concerned the doctor because that did kind of seem like maybe I had a leak starting from higher up where as opposed to when your water normally breaks", "it starts below and that is why you have that gush of water mine kind of had a tear at the top", "so it was trickling down really Lo and are really slow rather not low so that is why they were concerned at that point because my amniotic fluid was a little bit note low nothing like crazy", "but it was definitely getting low", "so the doctor said he was going to do another test it was a little bit more of an extensive test on the fluid", "and that came back to be positive for amniotic fluid so at that point he walked in", "and he basically told me in Byron", "hey listen when your amniotic fluid starts to get low and obviously we have tested the fluid", "and it is amniotic fluid", "your risk and the baby is risk for infection and death", "go up significantly", "so I really trust my doctor", "he is the same doctor that delivered myself my brother and he is like the most popular doctor at my church he has literally delivered hundreds and hundreds of babies at my church", "he is a really awesome doctor", "and he he is recommended by all my girlfriend", "is have gone to him", "so I trusted what he said and he is like if I send you home", "there is a chance that you can get an infection and something could something bad could happen and so that is why is like", "basically we are gonna induce you today", "and he left the room I kind of started crying a little bit because I was I was scared at that point", "I kind of had a feeling that Oliver was going to come early", "but it was it was scary to think that it was going to happen today right now and that they were gonna induce me", "and I was worried because I was 37 weeks", "and I kept asking like", "is he is", "he developed enough like I", "you know is", "it gonna be okay", "and they kept saying you are full term", "you are full term", "it is okay", "well they ended up coming back to me about an hour later and saying actually according to your ultrasound removing your due date up to the 15th", "so it ended up being that he was 38 weeks in three days which made me feel a lot better than even 37 weeks because that meant that he was like a week farther along than we had initially thought the entire time", "I was pregnant", "the ultrasound was showing that he was a little bit bigger than what we had thought", "so that eased my mind a little bit that he was a little bit older", "and I did not have to worry quite as much at that point", "they took me into the delivery room they put something called survey dial inside of me which is basically it ripens cervix they put that inside of me which Byron said I looked like The Exorcist when they were putting that inside of me because it is a long story", "but it hurt and they put that in there and that was not for 12 hours and that basically just kind of prepared my cervix thinned it out", "and it is called ripening the cervix that took 12 hours in that 12 hours that also got contractions going now", "contractions were not crazy crazy strong for me", "but I had to be induced via pitocin", "so there was no other option once your water breaks basically what happens is", "the baby does not have cushion anymore and the risk for infection goes up and they like to get the baby out within 24 hours", "so that is why was a little worried that things were going to go fast", "you know I had watched the business of being born and although I had planned to have a epidural", "and I had made certain decisions for myself that were different than the business of being born", "I felt like everything that was happening was like the opposite of the business of being born like pitocin and and all these things that initially I all I cared about was a healthy baby", "but I was", "you know these are like the words that when you hear it you are like", "oh okay", "I you know was getting a little nervous", "but they said we are going to induce you via pitocin starting at 12 30", "and she said once the pitocin hits your contractions are going to get extremely strong close together", "and they are gonna hurt", "and so that is why can get your epidural anytime", "you want it was 12 30 at night at that point", "and I had been there pretty much all day", "and I wanted to get a good night", "is rest", "I was going to get the epidural", "anyway I had planned on that from the very beginning and since they were going to start me on pitocin at 12 30 p m", "I figured I will get the epidural before they start the pitocin so that is why I can get a good night", "good night is rest cross my fingers", "hopefully I can get a good night", "is rest", "so that is why got the epidural", "I was a little scared at first because I thought you know epidural", "it is like a huge needle going into your back", "and you are like um honestly", "I felt like a tetanus shot in my back", "it was", "and I was having contractions at that point they were not anything crazy there were definitely contractions that I could handle and breathe through but", "the epidural hurt way less than even the contractions did so once I got the epidural started to feel kinda like this warmth in my legs almost kind of like I was in the jacuzzi and", "that felt good and I could still feel the baby", "but I could not feel any of the contraction pain or uncomfortability", "so that is why fell asleep and then when I woke up she came to like move my legs", "and it was strong at that point", "like I was watching her move my legs and", "they felt like elephants like huge elephant legs and they were like Gumby legs", "and I told her I was like this is strong um", "and at that point you know what some of the side effects of epidurals are you get kind of like the shakes", "so that is why was shaking and then also I was a little nauseous", "so they gave me an anti nausea", "they tried to warm me up", "so that is why was not shaking and", "obviously you know these are like the side effects of an epidural so that is why told her I was like", "the epidural is a little too strong", "can you turn it down a little bit", "and she said sure", "so that is why know it was out of 12", "so that is why turned it down to a 10 once they turned it down to a 10", "I was golden", "I felt great", "I felt like I could move my leg still", "but I could not feel any pain I did not have the chills or the nausea as bad", "so that is why fell asleep for the entire night", "and I figured when I woke up in the morning I d be at like a six or a seven", "I would have been dilated about a six or seven", "and I still had a ways to go", "so that is why was on Twitter kind of letting you guys know updating you", "hey it is probably gonna be a little bit longer before the baby comes you know", "when you are induced it is a little bit of a longer process so that is why put my phone down the doctor came in", "and he checked me", "and he literally looked at me and said all right", "it is time to start pushing you", "are 10 centimeters and fully effaced", "and I was like what like I literally woke up from a like from sleep", "I literally woke up to to them saying it is time to start pushing", "so it took about a half an hour for them to prep the room they sent in the the first nurse that helped me at the very beginning the previous day and biron me and the nurse we started pushing", "and I could not feel anything", "so I was like pushing I was making jokes", "I was like let is put some Beyonce on in here", "so that is why can like push to Beyonce and", "the pushing kind of felt like I was doing situps so that is why pushed for an hour and a half", "so it was kind of like doing sit ups for an hour and a half", "and I kept thinking in my head like what is going to happen when this epidural fades like I am going to be in a lot of pain", "um", "but I did not care at that point because she had her arms like all the way inside of me both arms", "and she was like helping to get the baby out", "and I just kept thinking", "oh my gosh", "I am so glad I ca not feel this because I would be a hot mess", "so and major props to any woman who has ever had a natural labor because I like salute you because I was watching that go down", "and I was worried about what it was going to feel like as soon as my epidural faded", "I pushed for an hour and a half he finally you know crowned", "they brought the doctor in my pelvis", "was a little bit tilted", "so they had to", "and he never does episiotomy", "is this doctor ever", "and but I had actually requested on my birth plan that instead of tearing I personally wanted to have an episiotomy so that is why gave me a PG atomy which is basically like a little cut", "but the baby was still having a hard time coming out because I had a tilted pelvis so they took the vacuum", "and I pushed one more time", "and they sucked him out and they put him on my chest and at that point I was like in awe", "I was like", "this is my baby", "and he started crying they took him away quickly", "and Byron went over and watched them clean him off", "and they asked for my permission you know", "if they could take him away and and do what they needed to do then they brought him right back to me", "and I started breastfeeding him so that is why did skin to skin I started feeding him and then within an hour they had me in the room upstairs in recovery", "my epidural wore off in about an hour and actually what was funny", "was", "you know they had told me that once you deliver your baby and you you know you are done with that", "then you have to deliver the placenta and", "so that is why kept", "you know", "I kept saying when do I deliver the placenta", "and they are like girl you are done", "like you are sewed up you delivered the placenta you have delivered your baby", "you are done", "I was like I am done", "I did not feel anything I think it was", "it was actually if I could give birth again next week with the same exact birth", "I would totally do it because Oliver handled everything really well they had him monitored the entire time", "you know I kept kind of worrying cuz", "people had said like with pitocin and an epidural the baby is heart rate could drop", "but he was handling it really really", "well everybody has different experiences you know", "and everybody is bodies are different and how they handle different things but for me it was a really pleasant experience actually", "and um you know I felt like it went really smooth and for the circumstances it could not have gone any better than I had you know kind of plan in my head", "once I was in recovery", "you know you do you do bleed", "and it is a little bit uncomfortable", "but it was nowhere near as painful as", "kind of what I had anticipated the day after I definitely like I took a motrin or maybe one or two motrin throughout the day I took a motrin", "and then I think five hours later took another motrin because I was like kind of feeling it down there", "so it was not like amazing feeling", "but it was not nearly as painful as what I had thought it was going to be", "so that is why was cuddling Oliver", "I was able to like get up and walk to the bathroom", "and things like that", "by the next day I was doing way better", "and I actually went home that day so once we got home", "they had mentioned to us that Oliver was getting a little bit jaundice in the hospital so they wanted us to put him in Sun and", "and things like that and at that point my milk had not come in", "so that is why was kind of just feeding him colostrum which is for those you do not know it is like the pre milk we took him in the next day to the pediatrician and", "his levels kept rising and so that is why basically said you need to take him to the hospital", "and he has to stay at the Children", "is Hospital and get treatment for jaundice which was really difficult to be honest for me", "and I did not realize at the time that that was super common so that is why were in the hospital two nights three days with Oliver being treated for jaundice with it", "is like a little UV light blanket", "and we had to feed him", "and my milk came in that day when we checked into the hospital so that is why started pumping every two hours to build my supply", "eventually we had to supplement for a few feedings and then my milk was coming in", "and I was able to feed him my milk which made me happy", "and it was just hard because I did not get to hold my baby", "he had to stay in the blankets he had like little eye goggles on", "and it was sad to see him in there", "but I had a lot of support from you guys", "you know people had said this is really common", "you know I had so many tweets of

first baby", "and you are kind of like a little flustered", "you ca not hold him", "and and there was nowhere to sleep so me and Byron were not sleeping", "and we were worried to fall asleep because

drugstore and", "then this product by elf which is available at Target I do not think it is available at every single drugstore but", "this is the eyebrow kit", "this is the medium", "and I mostly use this this side right here um", "and I just fill in my brows even though it is not really necessary to fill in my brows because I already have dark brows", "I just find that when I do fill them in they

fillers like I have seen expensive ones and this one is by far the best brow filler I love it", "and I have already had it for a year", "and I use it every single day without fail", "my next favorite product from the drugstore is the hair fertilizer which you guys have heard me talk about a lot I heard about this hair fertilizer um actually from Jennifer Hudson", "she uses it", "and I think I read about it in one of the InStyle magazines like probably a year and a half ago", "so that is why went out and bought it now", "you have to get this in the african american hair care department so not in the regular hair department", "it is in the coarse black hair department", "so you have to look for it there", "and this is the organic root stimulator hair fertilizer", "and it is a nourishment for healthy hair and scalp", "so it is like a cream and", "what you do is you take a little bit rub it between your hands and really massage it into the scalp and you can put like coconut oil on your ends and put your hair up in like a bun or in a shower cap and go to sleep and then in the morning you wash it out", "really really good and", "what it does is it has stimulating ingredients that help stimulate your hair to grow so keeping it in your hair overnight will help stimulate your hair to grow so it has a bunch of stimulating ingredients in it and hydrating ingredients", "I think it is like cinnamon and cayenne pepper", "so it actually like stimulates the follicles to grow", "and I found that it worked", "maybe I am like my head is in the clouds", "but hey whatever it is six dollars", "and I found it kind of like a fun little treatment to put in your hair", "and you can feel the tingling they have a serum version of this at Sally Beauty Supply that you can get", "but I think it is like twelve dollars", "and this one is six", "and this one is a little bit more oily so if you tend to have oily hair try the drops instead but that you wash this out really good", "but if you are looking to grow your hair or you are noticing hair loss or anything try this out see if it works okay the next product that is my favorite", "I actually did not get at a drugstore in the United States", "I got it at a drugstore in London and I am not sure if it is available in the United States if you guys know I would love to know", "but this is the Nivea pearl and beauty", "48 hour

stuff", "I am not a huge fan of like regular deodorants they feel like they clog my pores", "and I know this one probably does too", "but it feels a little bit lighter um so this is one of my favorite drugstore deodorants", "I am gonna try to start using natural deodorant", "but I do really like this one", "so if you know if it is available in the United States where I can find it let me know in the comments below my next favorite", "is I think available at Target in some drugstores in the UK", "I am not exactly sure how many drugstores or which drugstores carry boots number seven but this is a number seven beautiful skin energizing mask", "it is a peel off mask", "but this peel off mask does not hurt some peel off masks when you peel them off they hurt like they grab onto your like little baby peachy hairs", "and they hurt", "but this one does not it leaves your skin looking glowy and dewy and everything", "and I use this probably you know maybe once a week", "or you know twice a month

available and by far my favorite peel off mask that is available at the drugstore", "so try this one out this product is", "really great this is by Olay", "and when I used to work for philosophy as a skincare specialist they had a product called the micro delivery peel and it was I think 65 or 70", "I do not even remember anymore", "but um when I found out about this one by Olay which is called the microdermabrasion treatment I remember looking at it and thinking gosh that looks an awful lot like the micro delivery peel which I loved using back when I worked for philosophy", "so I purchased this one I mentioned it in my drugstore haul a few months back", "I have been using it pretty consistently", "it is actually almost out", "and I love to use this one", "you know like girlfriends come over and we are doing face masks and watching movies or", "whatever um", "and I use it on myself pretty frequently", "and I am Byron Byron", "I usually give him like I will sit him down and make him get like little face treatments so this Olay Regenerist is like a two step", "it is just like the micro delivery peel from philosophy", "so that is why have the physical exfoliant which is kind of like the citrus ease smelling and looking scrub and that you put on your skin first and that is the physical exfoliation just like any other granule scrub", "and then you put this peel activating serum with lactic acid over it", "and it has a chemical response and", "you feel like a little bit of warmth and the lactic acid is a chemical exfoliant which is lactic acid as what is in milk", "so when the physical and chemical mix it creates a little warmth and then you keep rubbing it in and leave it on for like I do not know like two to five minutes", "and when you take it off your skin looks nice and glowy and exfoliated", "and it is actually a really nice little treatment to have", "so I like this", "actually I use it all the time and it is a great exfoliation treatment", "it is pretty much exclusively an exfoliation mask", "so my favorite hairspray from the drugstore is Loreal Elnett satin this is the extra strong hold hairspray some people do not like the smell of this", "but this is by far my favorite hairspray in general even from drugstore or not from drugstore", "I do not like to spend a lot of money on hairspray to be honest and", "I also am NOT a huge fan of hairspray because I do not like when I ca not brush out my hair or it looks too stiff or", "it looks like I am wearing hairspray so this hairspray is extra stronghold", "but you do not really notice that you are wearing hairspray so that is what I love about this", "and I always buy the small bottle so that I can carry it in my purse um", "so I mean there is not much to say about hairspray", "but this is my favorite drugstore hairspray", "finally I have three drugstore blushes that I love", "and I am a big blush fan I use the", "can make blush that Ingrid gave me on most days", "but these are also some blushes that I love to wear and all available at the drugstore", "so the first one is by elf which is available at some drugstores and it is a very very pink pink pink pink blush so that is why have to like that like pop of pink", "but it is actually not", "too it is not too bad once you put it on", "I mean you could probably see it is definitely pink", "but it is not like clown pink", "so I love this one this one is called um pink passion that was especially if you are a big fan of pink blushes which I am", "and then this is the dream bouncy blush which I love I love to like feel this blush because it is all like squishy", "I love it", "and I do not know which color this is", "this is like the most raspberry looking one that they have", "and it does not say so that is kind of annoying", "but I do like these blushes", "they are cream blushes", "so that is why can even take a brush to it and apply it but really good if you have dry skin to use cream blushes and my final one is this is also a blush Abal cream blush this is by NYC", "and this is the cream stick New York or Barry", "and this is kind of like a berry blush and", "it is definitely a darker berry so if you have like a more olive toned skin that one is nice for the winter time", "so um that is pretty much completes", "all my favorite drugstore products let me know if there are some drugstore products that I

mascara", "it is very lengthening not so much thickening better with lengthening", "but it does help with thickening", "I would say the Lancome Hypnose is better for thickening but overall this is a better mascara for the price", "it is my favorite", "so sometimes I would use them both together to get the thickening and a lengthen but overall this mascara is amazing it does give you a nice thickening and lengthening not quite as much as the Lancome Hypnose so if that makes sense definitely a big fan of this been loving this", "I have gone through probably three bottles over the year",

tone I like to wear something", "plus I do like to have sunscreen", "and I think it looks better if you wear a little something so a tinted moisturizer is what I use on a daily basis if I am gonna go out the grocery store I am gonna go pick up you know food or whatever", "I pretty much always have a tinted moisturizer on because hey I pretty much run into somebody", "I know wherever I go so and

know on my chin or depending on you know the time of the month or whatever", "so that is why definitely need something oil free or else", "I will break out but if you have really dry skin you may want to use the regular version", "but this is my favorite tinted moisturizer of the year and again a product I have gone over and over again to replace", "so love this", "my next again you guys have heard about over and over again is the Kevin of Quan SX OH sensual skin enhancer", "this is technically a foundation but when I ordered it online", "I got it in the mail", "it was way too light to wear his foundation", "so instead I started using it as a concealer and a highlighter and was my favorite", "I have barely touched the tip of this concealer", "and I got it", "last year you can buy this at IMATS if you guys are gonna be at IMATS you can buy a cabinet quant online", "or you can buy Kevyn Aucoin at Barney", "is which is what I did", "i use the SX o2 which is rather light", "but it is my favorite for under my eyes down my nose you know to kind of brighten right underneath my brow", "and it is my favorite concealer", "essentially it is basically a concealer", "it is very very thick in my last video", "I said it was light when I said light I meant", "light colored", "it is very thick", "it is the coverage is extremely good so if you are looking for a really good coverage concealer or foundation make sure that you get this in your color and go get it try it out on your skin because I can never use this as a foundation", "but it is an incredible concealer foundation very very thick my particular sxo to is very very light colored", "so that is why wanted to clarify that because I know I said that in the last video so anyway Kevin a Quan sxo to sensual skin enhancer unbelievable product and definitely a favorite of 2012 um next is the elf eyebrow kit a lot of you are like", "why do you fill in your brows like you do not need to be filling in your brows your browser dark", "I like bold dark brows", "this is just my preference so not everybody wants to fill in the brows especially if they already have dark brows like myself", "but I have been growing out my brows over the last year I have been going to someone every month to get them waxed", "and actually I stopped getting my nails done every month because I would rather have my brows done because I I felt like once I started getting my brows done they looked way better", "and she fills them in even after she waxed them", "and her you know I get my brows done by somebody who works for honest ostia and or Anastasia Anastacio", "brows and they are all about thick beautiful bold brows", "so I got into the habit of filling in my brows and filling in the areas that are not quite as dark so that they are really bold brow", "and I love the elf eyebrow kit for some reason it is like the perfect color I never used this side", "I ever use that side", "it was like three dollars", "and it is been something I use literally every single day without fail I", "I am absolutely obsessed with it so pick this up at Target if you want a really good brow filler and", "if you have a similar you know hair and skin tone to myself my next favourites are what I wear on my lip", "I wear these two items and to face perfect lip perfect nude lip liner and this is literally maybe the exact color of my lips if not like just the tiniest shade darker", "like it is the", "it is the perfect nude", "and so what this is great for is when you line your lips it gives makes them look a little bit fuller", "but it is exactly the same color as my lips", "so that is why know it is not adding any additional color that is why it is the perfect nude so check out perfect nude lip liner by Too Faced", "it is an amazing amazing color", "and then I recently got this makeup forever this was gifted to me in a package I got", "this is the lip", "gloss", "I do not know how to pronounce that le vie re s ler", "I do not know make up forever professional lab shine star collection", "so all line my lips very very lightly with this", "you can go darker", "but I do not like that", "so that is why go extremely lightly around the edges one time", "and then I put literally a dab of this", "I ca not go anywhere without this", "this is s for makeup", "forever professional lab shine star collection best lip gloss", "so those were my favorite for my lips for 2012 moving on to skincare at the end of the day", "I mean I have tried a lot of different products", "but if I had to narrow it down to my favorite products of 2012 they would be Kate Somerville products because any time I have ever used to keep some of your products my skin just responds very well to it", "my skin loves Kate Somerville products I do not know why it may not be the case for everyone", "but sometimes you just find a line a product line that just works well with your skin and it happens to be an expensive line", "so I picked my two favorite items that if I could say okay these are the two you should save up your money and go buy these are the ones that I liked best so the first one is the Hydra Kate", "it is the line release by Kate Somerville", "any of her serums are good the total vitamin is a good serum it has like vitamin C lots of different vitamins so if you have pigmentation issues like sunspots or dark spots from breakouts that would be a great serum for you", "and I would go talk to some at Kate Somerville whether it be the counter at Nordstrom or the Kate Somerville store but for me personally", "my favorite serum from her is the hydra kate line release face serum", "it is like botox in a bottle", "it kind of like softens the look of the skin so that you do not have any fine lines wrinkles or anything like that", "and it is", "the texture is um I do not know it is like slick", "and", "but it really absorbs well", "so this is my favorite serum of hers but in my favorite serum of 2012 for me personally", "but if you are looking to get a serum maybe do not buy exactly what I got definitely go and talk to somebody at Cape Somerville", "but I would definitely suggest getting a serum of her saving up and trying one of her serums they are unbelievable but my all time winner of 2012 would have to be this Kate Somerville saito sell moisturizer the reason for this", "is I got in a car
